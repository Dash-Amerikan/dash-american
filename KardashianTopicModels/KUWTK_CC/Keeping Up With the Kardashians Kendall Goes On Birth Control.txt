- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo-hoo! You know, Kourtney comes here, like, every day. I have, like, never been here. Kim and I are out shopping together in Malibu, and I haven't seen her in a while and want to just catch up. Sister time. Where's Chris now? &gt;&gt; KIM: He just landed from London. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When are you seeing him next? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna go Tuesday night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's cool. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I'm excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's good. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm, like, a-doying without him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are. That's cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's so cute. I'll try it. &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you think of this? Is it cute? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is to die. That is so fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: You do? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is this rash on your leg? What are those red things? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have no idea. It's, like, been here for, like, a week. It's, like, getting worse. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Kimberly, I think you have ringworms. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? No, I don't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, yes. Ringworm-- my friend had it in elementary school. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, what is ringworm, like, a worm? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's, I don't know. A worm like those rings. I don't know. Are you using a new lotion, a new body wash? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I mean, I wore this, like, sequiny dress, and it was itching me everywhere. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't touch it. Don't touch it. Honestly, go wash it. Here, I have Purell. It's disgusting. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think it's contagious? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not a doctor. &gt;&gt; KIM: Feel it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, just feel one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim... &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, just feel one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:my anal cavity. It is like an old elephant's toe. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, that is so nastified. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's freaking me out. You can't touch me. Ooh! Stop! I feel like I'm in the Â Outbreak. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My day is carpool, fly my little helicopter, working on my golf game, and of course, going to the pharmacy to pick up prescription medicine for my daughter. It never ends. Hello. Bruce Jenner, pickup prescription for Kendall Jenner. &gt;&gt; PHARMACIST: $64, please, Mr. Jenner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. Have a good day. What is wrong with Kendall? She's got medicine. $60 worth of medicine. No way. Birth control-- I'll be damned. My little Kendall, 15 years old, there's just no way she's having sex. Why does she need birth control? I just picked... I was at the pharmacy and picked up birth control pills for Kendall? Why? It could be a mistake with the prescription. I don't know. Maybe it's for somebody else. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just went to the pharmacy, and there were birth control pills for Kendall. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you mean, "Yeah"? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you talked to her about sex? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you think she's having sex? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. But instead of assuming she's not, you should assume she is and be surprised if she's not. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Great, great. Okay, I love these assumptions. There was no way that my wife didn't know about Kendall getting birth control pills. Bye. And now she doesn't tell me 69 00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,926 what's going on? I got a problem with that. Kris? Honey, I've been trying to call you for the last half hour, and every time I call, the line's busy. No, Kris isn't answering. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's wrong? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You send me over to the pharmacy, and I pick up birth control pills. What the hell is this all about? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, it's now what you think, Bruce. The birth control pills... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you mean, "It's not what you think"? They're birth control pills! &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're birth control pills, and... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What am I supposed to think? &gt;&gt; KRIS: They help with little girls' cramps. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Please. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's got really, really terrible cramps, and it's really helped Khloe. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And it also alleviates her from getting pregnant, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's not sexually active, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How am I supposed to know she's not sexually active? Hey, you start taking birth control pills-- hey, baby, that just opens up the door. I'm just telling what reality is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think the only reason that Bruce is overreacting to this whole situation is because he hasn't been talking to Kendall and Kylie about what's going on in their lives with boys and dating and relationships. It's actually time that Kendall and Kylie got the birds and the bees talk. Since you're the one who's all hot and heavy over this subject, that can be your responsibility. I gave one to Kourtney and Kimberly, Khloe and Robert. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, right, Robert. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've done it four times. I'm sick of giving that speech. And while you're at it, you can give them your professional opinion on birth control. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I do carpool, honey. I don't do sex talk, okay? You can do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's for sure. I haven't had sex talk in years. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's your job. Come on. Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's not. You're gonna do the carpool and the birds and the bees talk at the same time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bye-bye. Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZO: Kim! Kimberly, here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Dr. Lancer. &gt;&gt; LANCER: Sweetheart, long time, no see. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, I have this, like, rash. Khloe seems to think that I have ringworm, and I don't even know what that is. &gt;&gt; LANCER: Well, Khloe went to medical school, I'm sure, but... ...let me see. How long has it been there? &gt;&gt; KIM: About a week. &gt;&gt; LANCER: Do they itch at all? Do they burn? &gt;&gt; KIM: A tiny bit. They just started. &gt;&gt; LANCER: And it's, it's new onset, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; LANCER: Okay. Well, it's not ringworm. Khloe was off. But it's psoriasis. &gt;&gt; KIM: Psoriasis? I cannot have psoriasis. When the doctor tells me I have psoriasis, I have heard of it before because my mom has always had it, but you know, my mom didn't have, like, red flaky dots all over her. &gt;&gt; LANCER: There are a whole bunch of things that influence this: stress, food, water, diet, travel has a lot to do with it. It may not be curable, but it's controllable. &gt;&gt; KIM: Not curable? &gt;&gt; LANCER: It's not curable because you can't alter the genetics. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, my career is doing ad campaigns and swimsuit photo shoots. People don't understand the pressure on me to look perfect. But when I gain a pound, it's in the headlines. Imagine what the tabloids would do to me if they saw all these spots. I'm not gonna get it on my face, am I? &gt;&gt; LANCER: Well, I think the number one way that you can help yourself is to try to sort of lead an easier, slower-paced life. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's just not possible. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm in the office. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, well, well, if it isn't the disease carrier herself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is that supposed to mean? &gt;&gt; KIM: Does that look familiar? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim... psoriasis. &gt;&gt; KIM: All thanks to you, my lovely mother. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, I obviously didn't give you this condition on purpose, you know? &gt;&gt; KIM: You could have warned me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know I got it at the exact same age as you. &gt;&gt; KIM: At 30? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Exactly. It happened when I was in the desert with Nana and Papa, and Daddy was there, and I woke up. Literally, it happened in 24 hours. And it covered me from head to toe. And it scared the out of me. I thought I had leprosy. Nobody told me about psoriasis. &gt;&gt; KIM: I thought I had, like, the chickenpox. I thought that, like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my gosh, yours is so bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, you're seriously stressing me out even more. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really do feel bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can tell. I can tell. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I never mentioned that you have psoriasis. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, laugh all you want. Laugh all you want. I mean, my mom should be upset about this, too. This is going to affect her just like it does me. And she's my manager, and I'm not going to be getting gigs. Good-bye photo shoots, good-bye red carpet events where I'm wearing a dress and I have to expose my legs. Good-bye anything that will possibly, potentially make you ten percent. It is really sinking in that this is something that I'm going to have for the rest of my life. Like, this is not curable. I'm going to have to deal with psoriasis forever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here's the bad part. When I got psoriasis, I was married to Daddy. And when you're already married to someone and you get, like, a rash all over your body, it's not so bad, but when you're dating and you have psoriasis, 177 00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:18,164 like, what do you say to somebody? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think right now is the perfect opportunity for Daddy to talk to you guys about the birds and the bees and... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You mean, popping the cherry? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: &gt;&gt; KIM: My whole skin is, like, on fire, and I need to soak in this medicine. Please just leave me alone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just don't understand... &gt;&gt; KIM: Get out! &gt;&gt; KRIS: All I'm trying to do is help you. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're not listening to 188 00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,688 me. Please get out! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are so rude. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe. Well, since I'm stuck with the birds and the bees conversation, inviting Khloe over tonight is a good idea. She's got a very close relationship with the girls. And.....she's always talking about sex. I'm doing batteries. 5,000 amps. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How hard would this make a vibrator vibrate? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have no idea, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't you give one to Mom. Make her a custom-made vibrator. So I just want to know how the whole birth control thing is going. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mom says it's to control Kendall's cramps. Honestly, my problem is, is A) you take that kind of stuff and, you know, it kind of opens the door to being a little, you know, promiscuity. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I mean, have you talked to them about sex? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. Mom wants me to talk to them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So talk to them. I think it's great to know, like, how educated they are, how far they've gone with boys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're not going to tell me anything. To you, they would talk. You have to be my little spy. But... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would love to have the sex talk with them. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, you're not going to have the sex talk with them, okay? You're just going to find out what they know and what they're doing. You know, from a sister kind of thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, what if they start talking to me about, like, sex and intercourse, and...? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. Let's just find out what they're doing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So is it okay if they know how toon command? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's a? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When your vagina makes a farting noise. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, why didn't you just say afart? Hey, I've been around long enough. I know that kind of stuff, all right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm having sex ed talk with them. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. Just find out what's going on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like I'm on a covert mission to find out exactly where my sisters are sexually? Do you have a boyfriend? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want a boyfriend? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you like, "That guy has a hot ass"? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you and your friends talk about men like they're meat? Prime "A," medium well? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So you guys aren't whore bags. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Better than I could say about me at your age. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I used to steal Mom's car. Got pulled over. I lied, I said I was Kimberly. I gave Kourtney's birth date. Went to jail. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my sissy-wissy. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's up, guys? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're just chillin'. We're talking about boys. Who has kissed a boy? Raise your hands. Who has kissed a boy with tongue? Raise their hands. Have you guys only kissed boys on their mouths? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys know what happens if you ever come encounter with a penis, right? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are you saying we have to, like, sword-fight it off? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They don't know that much, but it's better to inform them before something happens. I think that's good to have that line of communication. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What did you find out? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, I think you should definitely have a birds and the bees talk. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I definitely think they should know about some things. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have to get the to do it, man. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe we should do it together. I don't think I can do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes you can. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, I guess I can? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 265 00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,043 You can do it! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, Carla, come here! Look at this. &gt;&gt; CARLA: It got worse. &gt;&gt; KIM: So much worse. I swear, there was just like that part. It's like travelling up my body. I want to, like, Google this. My stress level is through the roof. I have psoriasis covering my entire body. That's someone's body. &gt;&gt; CARLA: No, you don't have... This is like severe cases. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoa! "Psoriasis is one of the most baffling and persistent of skin disorders. It's characterized by skin cells that multiply up to ten times faster than normal." What if I got like that? You have to call my mom and, like, just tell her I'm canceling. I cannot do this. So tomorrow I have a national commercial to shoot, and I really don't think I can do it, looking like this. &gt;&gt; CARLA: I don't know if we can cancel it, but... &gt;&gt; KIM: Well... 286 00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,167 &gt;&gt; CARLA: I mean, I'll call your mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're not supposed to eat until everybody gets their soup, Bruce and Kylie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh. &gt;&gt; SERVER: Mushroom soup. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is that? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Vegetable. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What kind of soup do you have? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Tomato soup. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everybody get different flavored soup here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: For our particular eating habits. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What a diva you are. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wonder what Kim wants. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We have to say a prayer first. What kind of household is this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hold on. Dear Heavenly Father, thank you so much for this meal that we're about to have. It's amazing. We thank you for all of our blessings. Amen. &gt;&gt; ALL: Amen. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's up, Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: There's psoriasis covering my entire body. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, you're just blowing this whole thing out of proportion. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm not. It's, like, tripled in the last 24 hours. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's got to be a different way that we can do this without having to cancel anything. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. It is that bad. I'm going to have to wear a sports bra, and I have it over, like, my entire stomach. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. All right, I'm going to come over and look at it myself, okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. It's so bad. I look terrible. The producers on this shoot are going to freak out when they see me. Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. 317 00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,970 &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm going to go, like, soak in a bath. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim's having this huge freak-out over her psoriasis. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: One time, before you guys were born, Mom had psoriasis all over her ass. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's disgusting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Then she would want me to put... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...like, special cream all over her ass. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She used to make me give her massages. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She made me do that when I was younger. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh! She made me. Such a slave driver. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, I am not a slave driver. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, you are. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All I am concerned about is Kim and the psoriasis thing right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, that's because you're afraid she's going to have psoriasis all over that money-maker: her big, fat ass. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what, Khloe, you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, Kris, not at the table. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's really not very nice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not at the table, we just said grace. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, you know what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going to go see if Kim's okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't, don't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ta-ta. I think right now is the perfect opportunity for Daddy to talk to you guys about... just... the birds and the bees, and... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, it's not. We're at dessert. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, it is. We could incorporate this in a little... sexual action. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You mean, "popping the cherry"? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ew. It's not actually a cherry, it's a hymen. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sounds like these girls know enough. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Not really. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you guys know what condoms are? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes. We found his dump downstairs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why did they find condoms in a drawer? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't pick on me, 'cause I have no idea. I was, uh... a long time ago. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You were what? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I was snipped, a long time ago. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your father had a vasectomy, which means they cut his balls off so he could no longer produce children. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. They don't cut your balls off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And he told me he wanted to be able to play, without the risk of having children. Your daddy used to get it in. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He thought he was the &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is probably not a thing to tell these girls. The bottom line... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't want them to know what a gold medalist you were? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, since I'm stuck with the birds and the bees conversation, maybe I should just man up and talk to the girls. Here's the bottom line: the bottom line is number one: safety. Number two: there's a lot of sexually transmitted diseases out there. A lot of them. Some that could kill you. I've been raising kids for a long time, with ten children. And, you know, the last two, Kendall and Kylie, are my precious little angels. There's a lot of really bad guys out there. Guys that are gonna push themselves on you. You are in control of the situation. And remember, if you ever have a problem with some guy, always call me. I'll take care of 'em. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Holla. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want them to enjoy their young years. But, I fed 'em three meals a day, and they're growing up. Kiddo, if you ever do, 10, 20 years down the line, uh, you know... Be safe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 10 or 20 years? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: For what? Having sexual intercourse? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're not allowed to have sex until they're married. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, I know that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I didn't have sex till I was married. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's not true. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you trying to say? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How old were you really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was incredibly young. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Can you tell me, or does it need to be in private? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm, no. I dated an older... He was like, like four years older than me. And he basically just like made me think I was supposed to have sex with him. I just was like, this is like scary and weird, and I didn't like it. But the guy, like, forced me. And then I didn't have sex for, like, three years. I don't know, I just feel like honesty's the best policy, and being open and honest with them, they'll feel more comfortable when something does happen, or if they really are curious, they'll ask, instead of them trying it. So, yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How old was Kim? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Kim was way before me. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How old was she? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm just kidding, I don't know. She will never tell you the truth. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim? Where are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Up here. Throwing out all my swimsuits, 'cause I can never go in one again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim's a perfectionist, and she really wants to nail this commercial. And being that it's outside at the beach, I understand Kim's fear. But life goes on, and Kim, you're just going to have to suck it up. I feel really bad you have psoriasis. I've had this my entire life. But I just don't whine about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you whine the first time you got it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, of course, I cried myself to sleep for months. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, be sympathetic with me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have a rash! It's not the end of the world. It really isn't. &gt;&gt; KIM: All my stuff, everything for all my red carpet events, are like these dresses. You know, sleeveless. I can't wear this anymore, because, you know, it's sleeveless and it's short. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim... &gt;&gt; KIM: All because I have psoriasis. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can wear whatever you want to wear. I do get it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You honestly, you just, you don't get it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have this! &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't! You don't get it! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, I do! Kim. You don't... you're not perfect, and no one expects you to be perfect. And everybody has something. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not like a photo shoot, where it can just be photoshopped. This is video. You cannot fix it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't cancel. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am not doing the commercial looking like this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is going to pass, I promise. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, you're not listening to me. My whole skin is like on fire, and I need to soak in this medicine. Please just leave me alone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just don't understand... &gt;&gt; KIM: Get out! &gt;&gt; KRIS: All I'm trying to do is help you, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're not listening to me. Please get out! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are so rude. 451 00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:19,325 Call me when you calm down, Princess. Today's the commercial shoot, and Kim's call time is in five minutes. Â - &gt;&gt; And she's still not here. I've called three times, and Kim's phone has gone straight to voicemail. I did not cancel the shoot. I took a roll of the dice, and figured Kim was overreacting. As usual. How awesome is this? Is this all for us? There are 200 crew members standing around, and I'm trying to be cool. But inside, I'm dying, knowing that all these people are waiting, and Kim might not 466 00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,783 show up. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know I can't let this client down, but I'm so freaked out I'm just going to go straight to the makeup artist, and see if he can cover up all of my psoriasis. &gt;&gt; MAKEUP ARTIST: What is that? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's psoriasis. &gt;&gt; MAKEUP ARTIST: I didn't know you had this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think we can cover all that? &gt;&gt; MAKEUP ARTIST: Kim, don't even worry about it. I mean, it's very easy to cover this. It's not even that bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. I mean, I'm really scared that someone's going to notice my psoriasis, but I made this commitment and I need to stick to it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim's here. They look perfect. You have nothing to worry about. You're going to nail it. I know that's my girl. She's professional. She's amazing. &gt;&gt; DIRECTOR: All right, here 484 00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,439 we go. Lock it, roll it, and... action! &gt;&gt; MAN: It's actually looking better and better during the day, you know? Most people deteriorate. What are you taking? &gt;&gt; KIM: A little psoriasis cream I rub all over. So the shoot turned out great. &gt;&gt; DIRECTOR: Cut. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo! &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know why I freaked out so much, but I'm just glad it's over. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks, everybody.
