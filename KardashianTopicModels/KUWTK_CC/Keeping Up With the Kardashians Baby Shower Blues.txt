- ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everything goes up my What do you guys want to do? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I want to do this. So, you take this side and you get in a plank. You know what I mean? And then you move like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know what happens if you do a plank on the regular floor? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: The same thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right, but that, you think thatball really does anything for you? &gt;&gt; PIA: Kylie, this does not do anything. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Go in circles. Go in circles. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, you do this. That does nothing. These girls have no idea what, like, real working out is. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; PIA: Got to even out the feet a little. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, what are you doing? Hold on. Wait, Kylie. &gt;&gt; PIA: Come on, Ky, keep it strong. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, them working out is... it's pretty laughable. Do your pants not ride up when you work out? &gt;&gt; PIA: I mean... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No... &gt;&gt; PIA: Am I doing okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I could never wear outfits like that. I have to always cover the camel. CTC. &gt;&gt; PIA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We don't have that issue, really. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, everything I wear, I have to do this. Like, have to have them long enough. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's so sad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you could see right now, you could see the whole insides of my vagina, 'cause these leggings are so far up my &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait, ew, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ew, you! &gt;&gt; SHARON: Hi! Welcome! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, how are you? &gt;&gt; SHARON: Want a coffee or something? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm good. I just ordered a salad. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Okay. We have some questions. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Some things to address with you ladies. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; SHARON: So, this party. Tell me about this party. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt and I are going to throw Kim a baby shower. So, we've been a little sneaky. We've set up a registry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She needs, uh, nipple cream. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does Kim need this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at this. In the zero to three. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh-ho, look at these. I mean, obviously we have to do, like, white. We can't do, like, colors because Kim might die. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Right. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: White roses, white mini-roses. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Here is your layout. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are we gonna have anything on the floor? &gt;&gt; SHARON: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For women with heels or anything? &gt;&gt; SHARON: Invitation says gardeny... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Garden sheik. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Sheik. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: And everyone that RSVP's to me, I let them know. &gt;&gt; SHARON: That we're on grass. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SHARON: And the C... Kanye's lullaby CD is the gift. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, love. &gt;&gt; SHARON: And this is how we were gonna wrap it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Me, too. &gt;&gt; SHARON: So, we're good? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. 62 00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:34,287 We are more than good. We are great. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, buddy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Is that your gun? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, yeah. I'm cleaning it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I thought it was at the other house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, there's nobody at the house that even knows how to use the thing. So, I thought, heck, I got the, uh, little safe thing out of there, brought it over here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That is so scary that you're even holding that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's no bullets in it, that's why... See? It's all apart. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Can I touch it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, sure. There's nothing in it. Come here. Once you fire it a few times, it's-it's fun. You know, you got your little target out there. You're out there. Bang, bang, bang-- trying to hit the targets. Not easy, takes a little practice like everything else. You know? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Did you draw that on Mom's face? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I would never do something like that, you know... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You're looking pretty guilty. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Hi! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Those are cute pajamas. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Yours are cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi! &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Hi, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Look at that! Oh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Everyone, thank you for coming to the beautiful pajama jammy jam. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Cheers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: First of all, I just want to say thank you, guys, because this is the best night of Kourtney's life. I have never seen her, like, honestly this makes me feel so good to see her like this. Girls, girls... did you see the pics? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your camel toe? On Perez Hilton? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I always have camel toe, and we have a nickname and we say "CTC," which it stands for "cover the camel." &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Like full toe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, like Moses parted the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We've all had our camel-toe moments, but Khloe lets the camel toe be shown. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is what it is. I have a big I can't control it. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: I've seen everyone in her family's So I'm like, "Wait, this one has maybe a puffy That one definitely doesn't." &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: Are you doing the math right now? Is that what's happening? &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Yeah, I was curious. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know Kim does not. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: I think that we should all look at each and everyone's &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Wait, wait! &gt;&gt; JOYCE: No, well, I want to see the... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So, I came downstairs the other day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And Dad was cleaning his gun, and I totally forgot that we had a gun in this house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, where in the world does he keep it? Like, I don't understand where the safe is. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. I just think it's really scary. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I hear you, Kylie, but you know what? Do you remember that great plan we had when he first got it and we were gonna get rid of it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why don't we follow through with it? Why don't we just get rid of the gun because neither one of us are comfortable with it being in the house? When Bruce first started talking about a gun, Kylie and I were really against it. I feel like now it's time to really make sure we get rid of this gun because I don't like the fact that Kylie doesn't feel comfortable, so we need to do something about it. There's got to be a place where he's hiding this gun. In this magical safe that he says he has. I don't even think there is a safe. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, right? I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's start looking for it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What about that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Up there? Is there anything in there? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, but that would be a good spot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I bet one of these books is, like, a fake book. It's like, he's not gonna put it in, like, an obvious place, 'cause he knows that we would take it. No. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Maybe it's in here. No one goes in here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nope, water heater. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's not under the bed. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, we're running out of options. So, I think that I have to tell him that I'm willing to play ball and I'm gonna make him think that I am on his bandwagon and I am suddenly gonna be into guns. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Great. Now we like guns. How is he gonna believe that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have my ways, my dear. Let's go downstairs and act like nothing's wrong and make Daddy some dinner. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at her eyes. She's like a Mufasa lion. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: One, two, three. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, look at that. That's wild. 156 00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:05,325 I want those. &gt;&gt; MAN: One, two, three, go. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Yeah. There you go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, lift it up, Kim. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Open the lips a little bit, a little more sexual 161 00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,403 in the eyes. Beautiful, perfect. &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you have a baby shower yet? &gt;&gt; MONICA: Not yet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you going to? &gt;&gt; MONICA: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We have to plan your baby shower. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't really care. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't care? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, I'm not into, like all the baby games, and... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't have to play baby games. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm, like, so not into that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Baby showers are formulated around you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I really feel like my pregnancy has gotten a lot of, like, negative attention for me and the baby, so I really just don't think that I need a baby shower. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm just saying you could do them, like, however you want to, but it's, like, fun to celebrate. You get gifts. Like, who wouldn't want gifts? &gt;&gt; MONICA: Ooh, God, this baby's doing back flips. &gt;&gt; KIM: I actually don't care. I just... I'm not in the mood for it. Like, let me just relax and not have some big, huge blown-up event. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, it's pretty crucial that Kim comes around and accepts that we have to have a baby shower because Kourtney and I have already started planning everything, and there's really no turning back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so what's the final say on the shower-- no? &gt;&gt; KIM: Who cares? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't want one? Is the answer "who cares?" &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I cannot believe that Kim is not into having a shower. I don't know where this is coming from, but it's not the Kim that I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't need a baby shower. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I got you this thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "This product helps to eliminate camel toe." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's amazing! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, why am I seeing this registry that was leaked? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe and I registered for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: If I said I don't want a registry, why are you trying to plan it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was asked to speak on a panel with Jeff Andrews at the Pacific Design Center. I have a crazy obsession with interior design and decorating, and I'm so excited to be able to speak about my love and passion. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, here's the deal. We have to go have lunch with these people right now, so before we get there, I don't want to talk about this in front of anybody, you know, because it's, like, family stuff, but we have got to talk to Kim about this baby shower business because I have to get this in the works. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She told me she doesn't want one, and I feel like these are the moments in life that you need to celebrate. That's what life's about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your first baby, you have to have a baby shower. Kim's making a huge mistake if she doesn't want to have a baby shower. One of the most special things about having parties to celebrate all the amazing things that go on in life is that it creates the most beautiful videos and pictures. So I don't want Kim to miss out on all the amazing memories. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Kourtney, we're ready for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She was so excited to have your shower, and I can't believe that she wouldn't be just as excited to have her own. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If we're gonna convince her to let us have a shower for her, we're gonna need to do it low-key. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Please welcome Jeff Andrews and Kourtney Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Kourtney, describe your style to us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love vintage. I love to steal my mom's old items, not that you're vintage, Mother. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, it's the whole family. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mazel. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, you big dog. Hello. Sit. Sit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He listens to me. Sit. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He don't listen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bernard, sit. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me, stay. Hey, sit. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I see that you're wearing a long top. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, so? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: To CTC? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's CTC again? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Cover that camel. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I try to cover the camel. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, you don't. You usually wear tight jeans pulled up to here, and then... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's true. You don't try to cover anything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When I'm in jeans, I'm not gonna cover the camel. In leggings, I'm not gonna show my camel. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So I got you something. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This thing. Here's a before and an after. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get out of town. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It should be called the Camel Cover. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "This product helps to eliminate what is commonly known as camel toe." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's amazing! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so put it in. Let's do... show me a before and after. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, Khlo, it's not for your anus; it's for your vagina. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo, go in the bathroom. I'm not asking you to do it in my kitchen. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ew! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, 'cause that would be inappropriate. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'd like to get one of these for my penis. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney definitely never ceases to amaze me, but the fact that someone makes this product... Obviously, I'm not the only person with this issue. It's kind of interesting, this whole cup for your I don't really get it. This is not comfortable. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It looked very comfortable. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's like you're wearing a pad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It didn't look like a thick pad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's still something in my &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Maybe you should use two, one for each side. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We need something to cool off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's pretty busy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, what can I get you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just a little tiny bit of that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I go with good old faithful here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys, I've kind of changed my tune about the whole gun thing. If somebody comes into the house, how do I get into the safe so I can protect myself? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got to know the combination. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's the combination? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You can't have the combination until you take a basic gun safety course. You just have to know how to use it. How to load it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Load it? Why do I have...? Just leave it loaded. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, the best way would be, is you take it to a gun range and just go out there and take the class. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: He said we can have the combination if we take some classes, so let's take some classes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How many classes do we have to take? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just one. That's all you got to know is know how to use the gun, know how to load it, know how to fire it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, will you go with me? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I hope the bogeyman isn't coming tonight. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: What am I seeing, that there's, like, this Bel Bambini registry online that I saw that was leaked? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe and I registered for you because we thought that you really needed some stuff. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't need anything. I don't even want to register. I don't want anyone to buy us gifts. I don't like... I don't need a baby shower. I don't even... I don't need gifts. I don't need any of this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Having a baby shower is a way for everybody to celebrate with you and make these memories that you're going to remember for the rest of your life. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who is that? Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna come, and we're gonna undo this. Where are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm at Kourtney's in the kitchen. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I'm coming by. Where is my nosy family at? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's nosy. I didn't do that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, whatever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's not called being nosy. &gt;&gt; KIM: But what, literally, if I said I don't want a registry, why are you trying to plan it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because we love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: My family is being so controlling, and this is my life. Like, I need to take control and do what I want to do, whether they like it or not, and I don't want to have a baby shower. Because you love me, respect my wish, and I'm not having a baby shower. It's, like, that simple. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go do this class. I don't want to be here, but I'm going to shoot the gun so, once and for all, we can be done with it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yesterday, when we were at lunch or whatever with Kendall, Kylie, Rob and I, he told the girls that he circleto me while I'm passed out drunk asleep, him and Lamar. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Shocking. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's so weird. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: He thinks it's funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I wanted to wear this to lunch with you, but I feel like I need to wear a shirt that, like, covers this a little more. 'Cause it's, like... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Ample camel? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney was like, "Your jeans are just too tight." &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I don't think so. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're not too tight. Myis just too big. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's an interesting set of problems. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Maybe you got it from your mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know what, everything is her fault in life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. How many things are you gonna pass down to me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you mean, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, you passed down premature gray hair. You said you started getting gray hair at 26, was it? And doesn't Kim find gray hairs on my head? Okay, and you passed down the biggestin the entire world, and now no matter what I wear, I have to show camel toe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, it isn't that bad, and mine looks pretty damn good, by the way. If you don't like camel toe, then start wearing longer shirts and enjoy your life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Listen, I didn't have an issue with my camel toe until Kourtney and Kim, all they do is talk about it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look, they're not the police, so I hope you tell them that and get over it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Slumber party! Come here, cuddle with me. No, no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, oh, you better get in the middle. She doesn't want to be next to me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is my book from my baby shower. Read Kim hers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll read it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, I wrote so long. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Shopping, dining and getaways are what we used to do all the time. This new journey is going to be amazing. I'm so happy you did it first, because I always copied you and watched how you did it so I could follow. I love you, Auntie Kimmy." &gt;&gt; KIM: True story. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can we just look at a video that I have from one of my baby showers so that you guys can see how much fun that I had with my friends? I think a really good idea to help Kim change her mind is to have her watch some of my old videos that we took when I had my baby shower for Robert. Oh, hi. Are we rolling? Here I am at my best friend's mansion with my other best friends who are giving me this wonderful baby shower. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at Auntie Shelli. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We are so chic today. We are just... These are my friends. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, this is great. Thank God. My dad! &gt;&gt; KIM: See? A guy always shows up at the end. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want those glasses. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: This is my, this is my first baby shower, and I'm thrilled to be here. Good-bye. &gt;&gt; WOMEN: Yay! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He was so cool. Oh, you guys hugged. I've never seen you guys hug. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I do get it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sister! &gt;&gt; KIM: I do love, like, seeing these memories and, like, reading this stuff. And I definitely want it. I guess I shouldn't really care. To say that all of this scrutiny doesn't get to you, I would be lying. But listening to my family really does make me realize that I want to really have this special moment for my daughter. I'm sure you think that's cheesy, but I think it's so pretty. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I think it's so cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's so cute. And I was just saying sometimes you just listen to what people say and take it to heart too much. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I'll have a baby shower! Seriously, Mom? Get it together. ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go do this class so we can get this over with. Oh, hi. Oh, you can buy targets? &gt;&gt; MAN: Excuse me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you can put your own face of somebody you don't like on it? &gt;&gt; MAN: You don't want to do that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, that would be bad. &gt;&gt; MAN: All right, you're all set. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait, I don't like that. &gt;&gt; MAN: It's going to be loud. Your ears are protected. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I need to go. &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay, go out there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think Kylie doesn't like the noise. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh,! I've always been afraid of guns on some level. And Kylie can't even be in the same room. She has to leave. I don't want to be here, but I'm going to go inside my head to a happy place and try to shoot the gun so once and for all we can be done with it. I don't like being around people with guns. That doesn't make you jump? &gt;&gt; MAN: No, I'm used to it. Now extend your arms out. Now you're in the bull's-eye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think I'm good. It makes me nervous. One to ten, what am I? &gt;&gt; MAN: Seven. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We'll take it. All right, I got to get out of here. This is freaking me out. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. Sorry, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I get really bad anxiety from loud noises. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm sorry. Come on. Let's go. &gt;&gt; MAN: So there's gonna be a written test. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nobody said anything about a written test. &gt;&gt; MAN: There is 30 questions. You have to get at least 23 right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. &gt;&gt; MAN: It's mostly common sense. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's no common sense when it comes to me and guns because I don't like guns. I don't want to be around guns. I don't want to know anything about guns. Ugh! I hope I pass this. 22. I don't know. Okay, I'm done. &gt;&gt; MAN: Give me a few minutes and I'll grade it. Okay, so you missed four, so you passed. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I passed! Whoo! Can I take a picture with you? &gt;&gt; MAN: Sure. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Brio! ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you see how big this one is? This one just, like, fell asleep. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have you looked that up online? Is there anything you can do? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I haven't Googled it. Swollen pregnancy feet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you have any thoughts about your baby shower invite? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I'm kind of debating. We kind of want, like, a ballerina on it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, that would be cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause, like, he just really likes ballerinas. And then there's that, like, Kanye, like, lullaby music that's so cute. When he heard it, he was, like, "I'm so excited. Oh, my God!" Like, just, like, little things like that get him excited for the baby. But I already bought everything on my registry. I, like, went online and bought it all. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You bought it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I think, you know, if we just say instead of gifts, like, they can donate to the Children's Hospital in Chicago. He really likes that idea. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: At least you could still celebrate... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and let everyone be excited for you and then not feel like it's making it a big spectacle. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, that's the thing. I just don't want it to be a spectacle. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know I have birds that live in there? Did you hear them? &gt;&gt; KIM: I can here some geese. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Crows. In my fireplace. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's so weird. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't believe I got a gun certificate today. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All we have to do is get our hands on this gun. We can go to him and say, "Look, we passed this test, we have our certificate, and now let us have access to the gun." &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We need to plan out what we're going to do to the gun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We can just go out to a pier and throw it in the ocean. It'll sink right to the bottom. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm not sure if that's legal to throw a gun in the ocean. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We can bury it. We could, like, dig a really deep hole in the sand. you get rid of a gun? &gt;&gt; KRIS: All of this is the same thing that people would do in the movies with a dead body. What else do they do with dead bodies? I got it. We'll put it in a bowl of cement and let it harden. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. Wow. This is phenom'. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to give a toast to Kim. It just hit me that you're going to have a baby, I think. We celebrate you, Kim. This is like how the gangsters did it back in the day. Kylie, stick the gun in there. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Drop it in. Awesome. Now it's Operation destroy the gun. ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, look who's here! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guess what. Look what I got. Look what I got! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yay! I passed the test. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: "Certificate of safety." Your official, uh... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Certificate. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...gun safety certificate. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-huh. Okay, I'm actually gonna even show you what a great shot I am. See? He said I was really good because I got it all right in the middle. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Dead center, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, I did. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This one was a little low, hon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, then I would cover your, you know, lower half, if you know what I mean. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. So you know how to use the gun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, so where's the gun? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, just a minute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You told me that if I got my gun certificate, you'd show us where the gun was. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That was the rules, Dad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So we went. She was my witness. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you shoot? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, I'm scared. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Been waiting for this one for weeks now. It's in the laundry room this whole time? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Come here. Making sure that... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't aim it this way. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not aiming it at anybody. I'm just taking it, make sure there's nothing in it. It's empty. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, let me see it. Okay, good. All right. Now phase two is complete, we know the location of the gun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're not some James Bond, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, I am. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, you look kind of hot with a gun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? Maybe we can play cops and robbers. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, now that I know where you keep it, you can have your little gun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, put it back, and I'm good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're good? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. I'll give you the code. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Awesome. Yay. Bruce finally gave us the code, so now it's Operation Destroy the Gun. Okay, well, I'm gonna put this in my little scrapbook. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why don't you have it framed? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I just might. And this will remind you about what a great shot I am. At all times, okay? You got that? All right, I'm going to go take a shower. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm very disappointed in you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That I'm late? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, you're, like, 15 minutes late. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, sorry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's something shoved up my, and you can't even be on time? You have some nerve. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How does that camel-toe pad feel? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's the most irritating thing, literally. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like I'm itching just thinking about your thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I get a yeast infection from it? Hi. Sorry we're late. &gt;&gt; GEORGE: It's okay. We do warm up. Lay down. Keep your arms on the side. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you see it? My thing is, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It does a body good. &gt;&gt; GEORGE: We're going to dance now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's, like, shifting. Like, I can't really do that. It's going to the left. &gt;&gt; GEORGE: Let's go, Superman. Let's go up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This little twerp really wants me to wear this cup to work out? Honestly, it's getting to me. &gt;&gt; GEORGE: Three, four. Jump jacks. Let's go, one, two, three... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't spread my legs. Kourt. &gt;&gt; GEORGE: Okay, one more time, knees up. Ten. Excellent. Marching. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This ain't working, sister. annoying. I want to cover the camel, but this thing freaks me out. So, Kourt, screw you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What happened? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I threw it away. It's done. It's never happening again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think you could wash it and reuse it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it's the most uncomfortable thing ever. &gt;&gt; GEORGE: Go! Jump over! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not gonna stress out about it. I have to go back to the mindset that I always had. If you see it, that's my gift from me to you, 'cause it's a beautiful gift. &gt;&gt; GEORGE: Excellent. Nice. Knees up. Let's go. Good job. High-five. Let's go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm like a kangaroo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See, I couldn't do that before. Lameer? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Lamar. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know you got an elephant in the garage? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: An elephant? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you think it's weird that you've never been to my house? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's a little weird. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think it's so weird. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: In three years... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you going to Kim's baby shower? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm supposed to. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Men don't go to baby showers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At the end, Kanye is going, and Scott was gonna go, and Kim said... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: To baby showers? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's gonna stop by at the end. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And so they were all saying is that all you guys come together. Like, it's at Auntie Shelli's house. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Okay, I'm with it. But that's weird, though. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You came to mine. Remember, I sat on your lap and we took a picture. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: At the baby shower? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, and Khloe... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's all good, just at the end to say hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So what time are the boys going? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 2:00, 1:30. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm more than happy to pick you up on the way. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You pick me up on the way, bro. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Pick you up at around noon. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, coordinate this with Kanye, because Kim's concerned he's gonna feel awkward. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: We'll go in the Murciélago. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're gonna be in an SUV. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You feel me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come downstairs with me. Daddy's not home, and I'll put this in the cement. Yeah, come on. Come on, quick. I don't want to do this by myself. I want to do this before he gets home. I swear to God, I am so nervous, my eye's twitching. So let's do this. All right, Kylie, fill that thing up with water. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How much water? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's probably good. Pour it in here. Okay. And we're gonna pour it back in there so it makes a block. This is, like, how the gangsters did it back in the day, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're monsters. Okay, stick the gun in there. Stick it in, drop it in. Perfect. Okay. Awesome. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It says here, takes 24 hours to dry. So we're gonna hide it till tomorrow. Bruce has never used a gun and will probably never use this gun. Kylie, put it behind the barbeque. Just slide it. Okay. We got to get rid of the evidence. Okay, so take this stuff and stick it in the Dumpster at the front of the driveway. He'll never look inside the trashcan. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi, babe. Surprise. I know you love surprises. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What'd you get me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Some details about Kim's shower have been leaked to the media. &gt;&gt; KIM: "As you might have guessed, these weren't just your old store-bought invitations." It's not loading. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And Kim needs to be celebrating this amazing time in her life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just feel big and heavy and fat. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Then guess what, honey, change your diet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had a salad today at Stanley's. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, on TMZ, "Kim Kardashian's baby shower preparations are well underway. In fact, invitations have gone out. As you might have guessed, these weren't just your old store-bought invitations. They arrived to their intended destinations in music boxes that wind up with a little ballerina." That's not mine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It says little ballerina? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, Ken got the deets. Some details about Kim's shower have been leaked to the media, and she's just over people trying to spin everything that she does in a negative way, and Kim just needs to be celebrating this amazing time in her life. Ken just wrote me back and said that you are the person that told him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did not. I haven't talked to him in three weeks. I never told him anything. So tell him he's a Get him on the phone. Get him on the speaker phone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, it's Ken. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, put him on speaker. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KEN: Hey, so here's the deal. Apparently, invites started going out this week, and whatever information they got to push people buzzing about June 2. Well, to my knowledge, no one's actually seen the invite. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I thought you said that he said I said it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, we were joking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, we're joking! You freak. &gt;&gt; KIM: My publicist just sent me a post that's going up either tonight or in the morning from TMZ with, like, every detail of what it looked like, except for there was no photo of it. &gt;&gt; KEN: Well, someone will probably sell them the photo at some point. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, totally. Kim finally agreed to let us throw her a baby shower, and I just don't want anyone's opinions to ruin Kim's shower. She's very hormonal, and I'll deal with her mood swings as they come. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not hormonal. &gt;&gt; KEN: All right, guys, I'll call you later. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Talk to you soon. Bye. &gt;&gt; KEN: Bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have to try to let some of this go. It's gonna get worse once you have a baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're gonna feel so much more protective. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Upstairs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Upstairs? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are somebody else's sandals in my room? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Let me see? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't know who these are? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Why do you look at me like that's so weird? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi, babe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Surprise. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Surprise? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I know you love surprises. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do love surprises. What'd you get me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I got you something. Even though you said you didn't need it, I thought it would be good that you had one. This is, uh, a little smaller version. It's still a nine millimeter, like you were shooting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's heavy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Very powerful, but a smaller gun for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well... Wait a minute, so now Bruce is buying me a gun? Now what am I gonna do? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll show you the differences 'cause this is a little bit different, the way it operates, than the other gun. I'm gonna go get the other gun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, that's okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I got it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, really, it's okay. Come here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, you need to compare the two. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, we are in so much trouble. Just go get him, go get him, go get him, go get him. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Why am I... &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's gonna go down and into the safe, and his gun isn't gonna be there. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, shoot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, exactly. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Guys? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where's the gun? &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't believe you guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I didn't know what you were saying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, don't make an excuse. Scott and Lamar came early to the shower. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't believe Scott and Lamar are such morons. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where's the gun? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What gun? Your gun in your safe? Kylie, where's the gun? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're the only one that I told the code to. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. Kylie, you tell him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's not fool around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You lead the way. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where'd the gun go? This is so simple. What are you doing with the gun? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have the gun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You don't play around with it; you have the gun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We'll show you where the gun is right now. Take it out. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I can't. It's too heavy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll get it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How did you do that? You're a monster. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, you go first. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm scared. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm scared. All right, well, here's your gun. Could you grab it, 'cause it's really heavy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's cement. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You could throw that cement block at the bad guy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, that's not even funny. Whose idea was this? What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was her idea. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is really serious stuff. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It was... it was her idea. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was our idea. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I... honestly I just can't believe that you guys did this, after all the trouble I went through. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, we didn't think it was stupid. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We actually think it was safer for us. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We feel better not having an available gun in the house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, uh, good news and bad news. The bad news is the gun... that gun is ruined. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The good news is I'm taking the gun that's upstairs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There will be a gun in this house, bottom line. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am so against guns, but I'm going to let this one go, and I'm going to let Bruce have his way. There's nothing else to do right now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can't believe the gun is inside this thing. That's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Look at this. Look at the flowers. Wow. This is absolutely beautiful and breathtaking. Amazing. From the gorgeous Lucite tables on that gorgeous green grass, the little lanterns in the trees, the flowers in the trees, the flowers on the tables. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi! Oh, there's champagne! &gt;&gt; KRIS: It is definitely perfection. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know, Khloe's wedding was here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you guys all for being here. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, we wouldn't miss it for the world. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so excited. We are all having a baby. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: We are so excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. Wow. This is phenom'. Hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Kimmy! &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, fabulous! How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: This baby shower looks so gorgeous. It turned out exactly the way that I imagined it to be. It's just so pretty and magical, and I'm just so happy with everything. Hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: You look so great! &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So do you. &gt;&gt; KELLY: Last time we were here, it was for Khloe's wedding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, that's what we just said. &gt;&gt; KELLY: Yeah, and I... I was sitting right there, and I watched Khloe get married, and now we're here for a baby. It's crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi! How are you? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You picked out names and all that stuff? &gt;&gt; KIM: That's the hardest part. I need, like, a real sit-down. He's definitely going to want something unique. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sweating all in between mylegs. It's like I'm a whore. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I want to give a toast to Kim. I... it just hit me that you're going to have a baby, I think. And I was doing really well until I walked by this table over here of all your childhood friends. And it reminds me of when Shelli and I were raising all of you guys and how much joy you brought me. You're an amazing young woman. You have the biggest heart. And I love you so much. And you are so strong. You take such an incredible amount offrom everyone. And you wake up every day with a smile, and I know you're going to make the most amazing mother. And I can't wait until this baby is born. You... you make me so happy, and this is... all these people are here because you are so loved. We celebrate you, Kim. Congratulations. &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you. My mom might be this, like, smart, really together businesswoman, but what really drives her is family, and that's why, you know, we all love her so much. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What also means a lot is for all of you, Kanye's family, to blend your family with ours, and we reach out to you with love. And before we know it, it's going to be a first birthday and a second birthday, and we have a lot of things to look forward to. We love all of you very much. Thank you, guys, for being here with us along the way. &gt;&gt; SHELLI: Hello, everybody. What would a baby shower be without a baby game? No teams. Good prize. You want to win. You want the... the-the actor or actress? Correct. Ryan Gosling was the Leo. Ryan Gosling. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know any of these. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, you know one at the end. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know four. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are they here? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi, Kourt! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: How's it going? &gt;&gt; CICI: Lamar, I missed you! Yeah, when are you going to come to Vegas? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Whenever you want me to. &gt;&gt; CICI: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are we early? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A little bit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where's Kanye? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We asked you to do one thing, Lamar and Scott: meet up with Kanye and come here as a group. Why can't you guys do the one thing we asked? I just... I don't get it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't believe you guys didn't coordinate with Kanye. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I didn't know what you were saying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, don't make an excuse. Although it's not, like, a huge deal, Scott and Lamar came early to the shower, but I think with Kim, it's important, and we want the day to be perfect. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't believe Scott and Lamar-- such morons. &gt;&gt; You want a bite of my wolf? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. Lamar and Scott were supposed to check in with Kanye to be, like, come at the same time. So, who's Kanye going to come with? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know, Kimmy. I'm so sorry. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi! How are you? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: That is &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Look at you! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel so bad that Scott and Lamar dropped the ball. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm glad you guys came. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You look beautiful, radiant. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: How do you feel? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ah! Kanye is here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; KANYE: I'm doing good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good to see you. Thank you for coming. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And now the shower can end just the way it started: perfectly. &gt;&gt; KANYE: How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; KANYE: I'm doing good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're here. &gt;&gt; KANYE: It's all, like, overwhelming, you know. I've been... I'm seeing, like, all family and everything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. How are you? Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; MAN: Good. Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; KIM: It all worked out. Kanye came with some family members, and it just was, like, the perfect kind of family reunion for him, and just, like, a really special moment to see him come at the end. &gt;&gt; KANYE: You know, I knew that all these people were coming, but it's like, "Damn." It's, like, a lot of family here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Every table was filled. It was fun. I am honestly so glad that my sisters and my mom talked me into having this baby shower. I'm going to have the most amazing memories of my boyfriend coming and all of his family and all of my family and all of my best friends. Everything just is so perfect. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm over here, Lamar. I'm over here. I'm over here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But I'm over here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't, Mom. Get over it. &gt;&gt; KIM: This better go up in your office. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It will. Next on: Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, this dog needs some serious training. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's six months old. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at him. Look at him. That's the most exciting thing that's happened to me in a long time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I sent an e-mail out to save the date for Scooter Day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not going to ride around my neighborhood on a scooter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I-I just can't take it anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know how sentimental my mom is. I'm nervous about being examined. &gt;&gt; KIM: The adoption attorney is such a better choice. &gt;&gt; Don't press your luck because you're now being annoying.
