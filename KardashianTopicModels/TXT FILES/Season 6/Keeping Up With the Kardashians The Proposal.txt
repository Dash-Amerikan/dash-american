Down one. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's a good round, man So, uh, Bruce, the real question is, you're wondering why we came out here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh-oh. Why? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES:'Cause, man, I, uh... I wanted to come to you you first... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: ...and ask you if I can marry Kim. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Boy, you have my permission even though you did. You know, you're not much in the golf department. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Come on, man. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: But I wanted to, you know, come to you first. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Smart move. Well, you got my blessings, you know. But you're gonna have to work on your golf game. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Bring it in, man. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When Khloe got engaged, I didn't learn for a week later. I mean, this guy's coming to me first? I love this. When are you gonna pop the big question? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Sometime this week. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? This week? Whoo! Scared? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Am I scared? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: A little nervous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah! I would be. Okay. We're brothers now. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You're technically my father-in-law. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We'll see what she says. You gotta get the ring, the ceremony and do the whole thing. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: That's the crazy part. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, you poor devil. Kris Humphries, he's kind of like me. I mean, he reminds me a lot of me. Are they a good match? Uh... I don't know. Actually, I've always thought about Kim's wedding and how over-the-top it would be. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What do you think she would expect? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Expect five, six hundred people. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Five, six hundred people? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, minimum. Can you handle something like that? How did you know that Kim's the one? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You know, I haven't had this feeling about anyone. You just see your life. You get that feeling. I don't know. I couldn't even describe it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yep. And she's not pregnant? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, she's definitely, she's definitely not pregnant. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's not pregnant. She's not pregnant. Good. So it's not a shotgun deal. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, she's not pregnant. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right! Honey! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kitchen. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, baby. Mwah. Do you keep growing? Are you getting taller by the minute? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, I'm just hanging out with people that are shrinking. Yeah, man. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's what happens when you get old. How was golf? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah, so I... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you gonna talk to her? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What? What do you mean, talk to her? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know nothing. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I asked Bruce if I could marry Kim. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. I'm serious. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You should have kept it a secret from her for much longer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, he's gonna ask. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? Oh, my God! Oh, my God, that is such good news! That is... I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You're crying. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My God, don't start crying on us, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm really happy for you guys. Do you have a ring? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. Actually, Jonathan, he's bringing it in tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Jonathan. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Jonathan's one of Kim's best friends. He's gotta bring the ring to L.A. because it wasn't ready when I left New York. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's get together tomorrow... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...you and me and Jonathan, and we can make a make a plan. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I know Mrs. Jenner loves to be a part of special moments and stuff like that, so I'm gonna let her help out a little bit. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So how are you gonna ask her? Have you thought about this? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Can we get some mini horses? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hell, no. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I got carpool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are we gonna do? How are we asking Kim to marry us? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: "Us"? 96 00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:50,097 &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is so exciting! &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Um... Now, taste this sandwich real quick. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: If you love me, you'll eat this food out of my mouth right now. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I think what made me realize Kim's the one I want to marry is just that when I'm not with her, I'm thinking about her. I look at her, and I see the mother of my children. I see someone that I want to spend my life with. All right, what are you gonna do? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have to go glam for my shoot. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Get in the shower. Head over there. I have to be there in, like, 45 minutes. That's it. What are you gonna do? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I might actually call your mom, maybe take her out to lunch. &gt;&gt; KIM: Fun, fun. I think it's really sweet that Kris and my mom kind of bond and spend time together. It makes me so happy. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm taking over this closet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You need to get rid of some of these Louboutins and purses, and clear out, like, at least half this closet for my stuff. &gt;&gt; KIM: Dream on. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, it's gonna happen. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm gonna throw you out the window. &gt;&gt; KIM: Dream on. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Mrs. Jenner and I are at the SLS to meet Jonathan to get the ring. Give me the ring now. Did you bring it? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: There was a little problem. It's all good. It's in a very safe... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Very wrong. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Listen, let me tell you... &gt;&gt; KRIS: These people are on to us. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Those people are on to their passports. They have no idea even where they are. Hola, señorita. Sprechen sie Deutsch? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it. We have a code name for our operation. We're calling this "Operation Pumpkin." 'Cause it's like a Cinderella story. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is unbelievable. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So what's the favorite thing in Cinderella? She, like, has to... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hold on, hold on. hold on, hold on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. What happened to the...? What happened to the ring? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Shh... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'll tell you what happened to the ring. Let's not call it that anymore. Let's call it... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's the mouse. We have to stay with the Cinderella thing. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: The mouse, the mouse. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Okay, fine. Let me tell you what happened. I went to pick up the ring. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Shh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: The mouse, the mouse! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: The problem with the mouse is that because it's so expensive, it needs to go to a place of business. It's on a Brink's truck on its way here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Jonathan has to have it sent by Brink's truck because of the value of the ring. When he went to insure it, they would not ship this any other way. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm sending it to Dash because it has to go to a place of business. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Dash?! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: One of you has to be there. I don't care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who's gonna get it? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're gonna get it because if he goes to Dash, she's gonna know something's up. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Code word for the Brink's truck is "carriage." The mouse is in the carriage. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: How about the mousetrap? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: This is so lame. Come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Dude, this is not lame. If this was going down in Minnesota, this would have been at a roller rink. Now you're getting a freakin' carriage delivering a really big mouse. So you need to calm down. This is not cow tipping. Like, relax. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Wow, wow. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Sorry, Minnesota. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, it's called "my clothing store," one. And two, I can't find you. So Jesse told me you were here, and I decided to stalk your ass. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe never comes to the stores anymore because it's just too crazy when she's there. I never expected to run into her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I signed for a shady little package from you. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is this what she's talking about? &gt;&gt; BRITNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is that for? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It is a... my checks that I ordered. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. It says it's $2 million. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what this is? It's the check from Keith Frankel. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, no, it's not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seriously, what is that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's really rare that I'm at a loss for words, but I don't know what to do, and I'm pulling stories out of my ass. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are doing something very weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I am doing something that perhaps has something to do with you, and I can't say anything because your husband would kill me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, what's happening? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nothing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm getting really freaked out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nothing, nothing's happening. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, just tell me what it is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I will not tell you what it is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to tweet that you're getting plastic surgery if you don't tell me what it is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can tweet to your heart's content, honey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Please, just tell me what you're doing. I'm very uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not going to tell you what... I have to go see... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't like surprises. They make me so awkward. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Has Lamar called? Lamar hasn't called here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this really about me, or is this a joke? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had-- I had a Brink's truck come here to deliver something to me. You can't time a Brink's truck to show up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No way. You said it was for me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's unfortunate that you signed for it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You said there was a surprise for me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't say it was a surprise for you. I... I've said nothing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, I know you're getting old, but you just told me, "Lamar has a surprise for you." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you, and we'll talk later. Did you want to talk to me about anything else, since you drove all the way over here to find me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 225 00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,482 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I'll work on that. Hello. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hey, uh... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You were supposed to meet me on the street. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I know, but I think there's paparazzi down the street. Why don't you come around the back of the house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The back of the house? If she sees me, how are you going to get this box? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: She's upstairs doing her hair and makeup. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mother! Oh, here they come. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Put it in your purse... 238 00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:59,632 &gt;&gt; KRIS: My purse?! Morning, everybody. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All right, we're good, we're good. I know you looked. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Beautiful. Oh! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Shh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You're not in touch with reality. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's not true. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It is true. After this fight with Kim, my nerves are feeling just kind of uneasy about this right now. 250 00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,841 All right, I want to make a toast. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm taking you somewhere special tonight. Dinner-- it'll be a good time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Somewhere special like where? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't know-- that's, that's a part of it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Tonight is the night I'm going to propose. I'm so nervous. I don't even feel like myself. &gt;&gt; KIM: What do I wear? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, I need to ask you something. Babe? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, for real... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: I want to ask you something. Remember when you met Brody and his girlfriend Avril? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is a dead serious question. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: She is selling her house. Eight bedrooms, 12,000 square feet, gated community, Bel Air. I think it's perfect for me. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Wait, baby... &gt;&gt; KIM: Us, us, us. I think we should get it-- together. 'Cause I need help paying for it. It's very expensive. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Listen, listen... &gt;&gt; KIM: It's this exact house. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Listen, finish paying off this house... &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, it's done. It'll be done tomorrow. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris is one million times more frugal and conservative than I am. Which is great, but we both work hard, and we both choose to spend it in our own ways. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You just did it. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, no, no. My pillows are freshly done. Oh, my God. You seriously... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, don't. Don't. Seriously when you get in a... 285 00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,462 &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Get over here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, what a gentleman. Babe, let's get a house in Malibu. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: That's part of the surprise. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Let's just spend all of our money. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I can live off my parents later, once you figure out that we're broke. They'll have my back. I'm not worried about that. &gt;&gt; KIM: That other house is just redic. That's like my dream home. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: How is Avril's home your dream home? &gt;&gt; KIM: I've seen it twice. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I have a financial plan laid out for my life, okay? Bringing you into my life is not going to, like, derail my plan. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not trying to derail your plan. But I'm sorry-- if we're going to back to New York, I can't downgrade my style. If you really want me to move to New York, like, I can't live in a low-- a lesser lifestyle than I live now. You know what I mean? It's not worth it to me. Like... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's not worth what? I'm not worth it? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not saying you're not worth it, but you're going to have to, like, get a nicer place. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I think I just threw up in my mouth a little bit. In my mind, we're about to be married and share everything. Am I about to marry this wild card who could potentially want to spend everything that we have? When did you get so fancy that you have to have... &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to live in a college dorm. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's not a college dorm. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, it's not. It's a new building. It's nice. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is. Kris's apartment is really cute, but I like to be as private as possible, and when you're walking in and out, people can just go up to your door. That bothers me. For real. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: That's why for sure we're keeping our money separate. You have issues. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have issues 'cause I don't want to live in a college dorm? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, because you're not in touch with reality. 328 00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:52,765 &gt;&gt; KIM: That's not true. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It is true. Oh, my God. I'm panicking. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so excited for tonight, because Kris is going to propose at Geoffrey's at the beach. So I've invited the whole family. This is going to be a great night. Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so surprised to see everyone. I knew Kris's sister was in town. I think it's really sweet of him to plan a big family dinner, since he knows how important family is to me. Hi. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hey. &gt;&gt; KAELA: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Everyone, this is Kaela. &gt;&gt; KAELA: Hi. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Good to see you. I'm so glad you're here. After this fight with Kim, my nerves are feeling just kind of uneasy about this right now. And I'm not sure I want to do it tonight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is not a bib, this is a Dolce &amp; Gabanna fabulous. &gt;&gt; It's very Liberace. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It fits. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can barely see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I get another glass of wine? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Name names! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't name names. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Name names now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can't name names. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What about that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait a minute! Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She made him get Botox and use electrolysis. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Literally. &gt;&gt; ROB: Tell that to J.Lo. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like I'm going to have an anxiety attack, waiting for this to happen. And every time I glance over at Kris, he's not even making eye contact with me. Maybe they have some pumpkin pie for dessert. Just saying. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Kim's mom's looking at me. Jonathan's looking at me. They're like, "Do it. Do it. Uh. Uh." They're all stressing me out even more. Okay, let me just stop there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Did she say she looks like Chris Penn? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All right, I want to make a toast to everyone meeting my sister for the first time. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Hey! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's never gonna come back. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: And, um, you know, to really hanging out with Khloe for the first time. And, uh, to beautiful Kim. I love you. So eat up. I'm going to pick up that piece of chicken, and bite it with my mouth. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Dude, you're killing me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I'm going to go. Bye, guys. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It's almost midnight. I want to go home. Oh, no, where you going? &gt;&gt; ROB: I should go, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God... I feel really bad, because either he's really, really nervous, or he's just changed his mind. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Look, you gotta relax. You're almost blowing it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have to relax? You're making me crazy, dude. I mean, are you getting, like, cold feet? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, not at all. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We had a little fight today, so, you know... I just want to be in great spirits when it goes down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You sure? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah, yeah. Have a good night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. 390 00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,850 Yeah, you too. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: See you. &gt;&gt; KAELA: Are you going to drive like a crazy person? Just let me know right now. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: My sister's someone I can talk to about anything. I want to get her opinion. I definitely don't think I want to propose if I'm not feeling really great about it. We got into this little fight. We had never really gotten in an argument, and it's... it's getting a little bit heated, and I'm sitting there, and I'm like... I wouldn't say I was second-guessing it, but I think I was psyching myself out. I was just like, oh, my God, what if it gets worse from here, blah, blah, blah. I just was thinking everything negative possible. &gt;&gt; KAELA: Worst-case scenarios. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. But we finally settled it, and everything was cool, and like, I got right back to where I was before. &gt;&gt; KAELA: Mm-hmm. And we had a conversation before about, you know, is she the one? And you said "yes," without a hesitation. That's the most important thing. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Kaela's right. Kim's the girl for me. And I definitely realized that I'm ready. &gt;&gt; KAELA: Do you know what you should do? You should sing it. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Sing it for me. Show me how it should go. &gt;&gt; KAELA: ♫ Kim Will you marry me? ♫ 416 00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,414 &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: This is the biggest moment in my life, and it's very nerve-wracking. Oh, my God. I chose her bedroom to ask her to marry her there, because to me, our love is simple, and I don't want like all the distractions and everything crazy going around. I just want it to be in her home, quiet and perfect. 424 426 00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:10,156 428 00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,594 430 00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:30,209 431 00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,245 433 00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:45,625 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh... my God. This is like... the moment that every girl has dreamed of their entire life. You're crazy. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I love you. Will you marry me? 440 00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:05,511 &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God-- yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. I'm like shaking. I'm honestly speechless. It's so beautiful, and it's so sweet, and I just know Kris is so nervous. : Oh, my God. 446 00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,962 Oh... my God. This is so crazy. It's so perfect. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You're perfect. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my gosh. : Oh, my God. Oh... Oh, my God, we're engaged. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm in shock right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're engaged! 455 00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:54,160 ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys, let's come sit down! &gt;&gt; KIM: We are going over to my mom's house to a family barbeque, and I am just so excited to tell everyone that we're engaged. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There they are! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, late as ever. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What is it, your Sweet Sixteen? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What's up, man? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Uh... you have an engagement ring? Uh, you have a ring. What? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's a fake ring. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is on your hand? &gt;&gt; ROB: What's up, man? You're certain? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this real, or a joke? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Say Bible. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's a joke... it's a joke. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bible. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bible! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He just said it's a joke. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Well, sometimes I just say things.
