- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, buggle. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How's it going? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just trying to get my stuff going. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're bringing all these clothes? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, it's London. I mean... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I get it. They dress fab, but what... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I dress fab. Kim is in London doing a couple appearances for some of her businesses, and Rob and I were able to land and appearance, so we're all gonna meet up in London. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: People in London, they're very classy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's that supposed to mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You'd better behave yourself like a proper gentleman. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Once I get out of those doors, it's beast mode. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, live it up, party boy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ah, yeah. 18 00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:42,109 You want to come with me, and I'll pack you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Totally, babe. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHERS: Kim, Kim, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: So we are here in London, and I'm here to launch my new fragrance in the U.K., so it's really 23 00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:10,537 exciting. The crowd and the people... it's so overwhelming. And Kanye's here on his tour, but we're both so busy that it's gonna be hard to really spend a lot of time together. So I want to have a little piece of home with me, so I'm inviting Jonathan to come and hang out for the week. &gt;&gt; JOURNALIST: What inspired your new fragrance? &gt;&gt; KIM: I wanted something heavy and gardenia. Like, something that lingered. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: This is Jonathan, my best friend. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Good. How you doing? Nice to meet you. How's it going? What is going on here? This is like a whole... &gt;&gt; KIM: It's my fragrance, like, launch. That's why we're here in the... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You didn't... I didn't know you were working like this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: All right, go do this, we'll talk when you're 43 00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,277 done. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you sure? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I collect fragrance, so I think every fragrance is different for, like, a different mood. &gt;&gt; JOURNALIST: And what's the one product you could not live without? &gt;&gt; KIM: I cannot live without painted nails. &gt;&gt; JOURNALIST: Really? Well, thank you very much. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know Scott and Rob are coming, too? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Why'd you make me come all the way out here when they're coming, too? What did you need me for? You're crazy. &gt;&gt; KIMM: Do you want to go to the parties? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, but do I have time to go sightseeing and stuff? &gt;&gt; KIN: Yeah, but I have to start hair and makeup in 15 minutes. I'm just, like, oh, my God. I need a nap. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, this is pretty dope. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can you believe Kanye sent this? Oh, my God, he's gonna love this. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, he's sick. &gt;&gt; KIM: How sick this is. So Jonathan and I walk into the hotel room, and I show Jonathan all the stuff that came from Kanye. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Sick. &gt;&gt; KIM: Prada dress. Prada. His own line. This Prada dress. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: He picked this all out? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yep. Well, I am going to go to bed. I have to start hair and makeup in ten minutes. For real. So I need to take, like, a ten-minute nap, and then I have to shower. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You seem very busy. I hope you're gonna find some time to hang out. I just want to see tourist stuff... 75 00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,361 &gt;&gt; KIM: I love you, but look at Buckingham Palace out of the window. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. Dude, killer room. &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott definitely is fun to hang out with, another guy. I'm surrounded by all women, so it's fun to kind of, you know, bond, hang out, and throw a few back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait, are you wearing a robe and Jordans? I thought we were staying at The Dorchester. Why are we staying here? &gt;&gt; ROB: Because the Queen is staying at The Dorchester. She doesn't want Kim there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Initially we were gonna stay at The Dorchester, but evidently the Queen happened to just want to shut it down. It's pretty impressive that one woman can shut down a whole hotel just because she wants to be there. You want to, like, cuddle a little? &gt;&gt; ROB: All right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just come down for the real thing. I know you do stuff like this with Lamar all the time. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, but... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're faking it. &gt;&gt; ROB: But I'm in a robe and you're in a suit. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll take it off. Are you smelling me? Now you're getting way weirder. &gt;&gt; ROB: You smell like vodka. Kourtney told me to smell you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, obviously Kourtney's not coming because she's at home and very pregnant, but, you know, Rob's always fun to travel with. We tend to get into a little bit of trouble sometimes. What up? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's up? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Kim told me you guys were here. I didn't know you were coming here. She loves to surprise me. She's like, "I'm so bored, come here," and then she's like, "Oh, Scott and Rob are here." So come back? Okay, Beyoncé. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My God, you didn't even wait for me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That looks really good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie said she's gonna move in with Kendall at a condo, but Kendall's gonna pay for it all. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: If you're living there, you'll pay for food. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Could you guys not get so excited about leaving me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, just think about it. If they both move out in a year and a half, we'll have the house all to ourselves. Two little lovebirds just like we started. It'll be fabulous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Shoot me. You have a dark side that nobody else sees but me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please. I have a dark side. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You do. You have a dark side. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at this sweet face. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You moved my tennis racket that I put outside in the garage. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I didn't move anything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You did something with my tennis racket. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If anything, I put it where it belongs. In the cabinet where all the other tennis rackets are. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I looked in every cabinet of the garage. I put it in a specific place in the garage. It's not nice. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Wait, Mom. You loaned me the tennis racket two days ago. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I didn't. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How do you not remember that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seriously, get over it already. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just don't see the other side of him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like no matter what, my mom does tend to blame Bruce for, like, anything no matter what it is. And it's so mean. And it's so uncalled for. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, Khloe, there's a Boston trip that we're gonna do. Kim was supposed to go. So I would love it if you could fill in for her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't really get options in my life. I'm just told and instructed at what time to be there, and then I have to do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Now you're talking. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yep. Just traveling with my mom and Bruce, and envisioning my mom nagging Bruce the whole time is already giving me a piercing migraine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe we can go see Plymouth Rock. Wouldn't that be fun? A big rock sitting there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't torture me. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's going on? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nothing. I want to do something in London. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What are you complaining about? Kim tricked me. She said we were gonna do all this fun stuff... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I want to see the Windsor Castle. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, it's not gonna happen. The royal stuff... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Because it's the Jubilee weekend here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'll show you what it means. That's what I mean. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is what's going on. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is all for the Queen? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, the Queen's sitting right there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, look at her. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: There she is. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She gets frigging airplanes everywhere. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: She owns this place. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm sick of, like, nightclub appearances for, like, a couple hundred people. Like, I want to be saluted like this. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Right. You don't want to, like, shake hands, you want to wave like this. You got to wave. You got to give them a wave. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's pretty cool because the Queen is having her 60-year anniversary, which is the Jubilee. It seems like the popular kid in high school feeling to be royal when you're in London. I got to move, when I get home, into a castle. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: The good news is, you got a head start 'cause, you know, Kim is "Her Royal Highnass." So you already have one royal in the family. Now you just got to... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's a royal pain in the ass. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That, too. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Jonathan came all the way from New York to be with Kim, but Kim is obviously really busy, and Rob and I are more than happy to have Jonathan come along with us and take him sightseeing with the boys. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Wow. Is this it? The guards are out when she's here. Yep, there she is. Look. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's got to do that all day? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: All day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I want to get people to do that at my house. What? Is the Queen home? I don't get it. So she's home? The royalty here is much more respected than anything else. This is unbelievable. How many square feet is this house? I mean, she's got room. How much room does one woman need? Walking around London, seeing how much is going on for the Queen is pretty unbelievable. This is like shutting down a whole entire city for this. It's huge. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, Kim just texted me. Her Royal Highnass is requesting my presence. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You'd better get back 202 00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,322 to your duties... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...my kind sir. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: God, it's as hot as my mother in here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, in the future, I don't want to drive this car. Rolls Royce screams, "I'm throwing my money around. I've got more money than you, and I'm just gonna waste it on a car." &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a beautiful car, and it's my choice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: First of all, it's not good for my image. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your image? It's not good for your image? What's your image? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rich guy throwing it in people's face. That's not me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your image is already screwed up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, my image is in great shape. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, your image isn't in great shape; your image is, you always look like a hot mess. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, you know what, you can take her to the car, okay, and you can just drive her home yourself. Kendall's behind me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What is he doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What the... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, there they are. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, don't get out of the car. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm getting out of the car; you can drive your own car. I don't want to drive your car. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're being an idiot, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just drive your own... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, you're gonna do this in front of your teenage kids? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, good lesson to learn. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everyone seems to think that Bruce is this really normal guy, but under certain circumstances, he snaps, too. 231 00:09:56,096 --> 00:10:03,169 Like, this is ridiculous. I'm sorry that you had to see him do that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, Mom's crazy. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And what did you do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's got the shortest fuse, and nobody else sees it. He knows how to push every one of my buttons, and... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: But you know how to push all his, too, so... &gt;&gt; MAN: Do you, Scott Disick, enter the position of feudal lord and take up the title with a good heart? &gt;&gt; ROB: I can't take this whole thing seriously. It's just weird. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Car's here! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Calm down. Bruce is being more than difficult, and we haven't even left the house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go, we... 244 00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:37,237 &gt;&gt; KRIS: You say "let's go" one more time, I'm gonna stab myself in the eye with a fork. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar and I, we adjusted our crazy training up at the top of the hill. And we typically walk on the sidewalk. Are you listening, or no? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What'd I say? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm over it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, you have to tell me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't have to. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, you do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't. Okay, but anyway, I guess since you're preggers, I agreed to go to Boston for Kim with Mom and Bruce. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They're just annoying together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They are. She just yells at him and gets on his case about anything and everything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They make it uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, to me, is, like, easy peasy. He barely talks. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just wish she could be nice sometimes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wish she could be nice to him. Why is she so mean... She resents him for something. It's very bizarre. Maybe I should just, like, put myself into the hospital for exhaustion so I don't have to go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's a good idea. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: Where are we going? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I heard about some place that's, like, a... a portrait gallery with, you know... &gt;&gt; ROB: Like penis portraits? Like, you know, there's pictures of a lot of royalty and old icons from London and, you know, cool things. &gt;&gt; ROB: Like vaginas? &gt;&gt; ELEANOR: Hello there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. I'm Scott. &gt;&gt; ELEANOR: I'm Eleanor. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, you're gonna give us our tour today, right? &gt;&gt; ELEANOR: Yeah, absolutely, here at the National Portrait Gallery. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, great. We're excited. &gt;&gt; ELEANOR: Brilliant. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, look at the witches. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, look-- it looks like the Kardashian sisters. Later, girls. Look at this guy. Look at the fur throws all over him. He's killing it. Look at his chain! I got to step my game up. &gt;&gt; ROB: I just didn't expect Scott to kind of want to do something like this. I know there's something to whatever we're doing, 'cause we wouldn't just go to London and go to an art museum. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at these keys! Do you by any chance know of a place that I could buy Royal-style Family's clothing? Even, like, an outfit like this I'd be fine with. Can I become a Sir? Or it's easier to become a Lord? &gt;&gt; ELEANOR: I think you've just got to do research on the Internet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna buy this guy to start asking around. Come on, my little friend. This new accessory is killer. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am so excited... to go to Boston with you two. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's just driving me nuts-- she's horrible. It got worse in the car. We're driving that stupid Rolls Royce. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's just ridiculous. I hate the car, you know? I don't want to be seen in the car. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. I don't want you to get worked up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not gonna get worked up, I just want to explain myself. I say to her, I go, "Well, it's bad for my image." And she looks at me and she goes, "You have no image." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's 'cause she's an idiot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is so rude! You're people's favorite. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: People love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. I only went out and won the Games and loved by people. Yeah, I kind of got an image. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Of cour-- Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I understand where you're coming from. My driver in Dallas was, like, "Your stepdad, when he won that, what an American! He brought it home for us." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I a hundred percent think my mom does not give Bruce any respect, and she definitely avoids involving Bruce in her life more often than not. I mean, I think Bruce needs more love and respect, and I think he deserves it. Kris Jenner's calling. Hi, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're at lunch with Bruce. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. Can I come have lunch with you guys? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, Mom, we're having a ménage à trois. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, why can't I join you guys for lunch? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're really interrupting our lives. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're interrupting. We're having a good story time session. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what, you guys aren't funny anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you, mean it. 332 00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:45,184 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, it's been a great lunch with you guys. Good old Boston, here we come. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Kim, I want to go check out that crazy Ferris wheel. We should go for a ride. &gt;&gt; KIM: That'll take like five hours. Do you see how slow that thing is moving? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We'll make them speed it up for us. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's always fun to do 340 00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:07,640 appearances, so I'm bringing Jonathan along so we can spend some time together. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Kim Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you all so much for coming. It was a dream of mine to have a fragrance, and I never thought in a million years I'd be launching it in the UK. 348 00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:37,503 I hope to meet you guys tonight and hang out and let's have fun. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Kim. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's go, Bobby. I know in L.A., you could, like, buy your way into fame, so you got to be able to buy your way into royalty over here somehow. So I decided, you know, I'll Google how to get a title while you're in London. And a few things popped up. &gt;&gt; MAN: We only sell genuine titles that are hundreds of years old. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is perfect. I'm going back to the U.S. a Lord. I don't know how you're going back. So, I'm going to be a Lord. How you doing? Scott. &gt;&gt; SIMON: Nice to meet you, Scott. Welcome. &gt;&gt; ROB: Rob. How are you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know what brings myself here today. He's not exactly sure what I'm doing. &gt;&gt; SIMON: We can have a ceremony called an ambassador ceremony. I can do the ceremony-- he becomes a Lord of the Manor. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, right. That wouldn't happen. That would never happen. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm excited to get my lordship on. &gt;&gt; SIMON: Okay. Do you, Scott Disick, enter the position of feudal lord and take up the title with a good heart and a belief in God? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I sure do. &gt;&gt; ROB: I really can't even take Scott seriously. I can't take this whole thing seriously. I mean, I don't know. It's kind of... it's just weird. &gt;&gt; SIMON: Scott, please kneel. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Both knees? &gt;&gt; SIMON: Your choice, my friend. &gt;&gt; ROB: You should be used to this. Come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is there a reason why we're taking Kris to this thing? You and I can do the whole thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can calm the down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Excuse me. You don't need to tell him to calm thedown. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll show you what I'm really trying to get-- some like that. &gt;&gt; KANYE: I'll have to take Scott to the store so he can buy, like, the full gold-plated everything. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. Stop encouraging him. &gt;&gt; SIMON: Scott, please kneel. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whether it's Sir Disick, Lord Disick, Count Disick, becoming royal is really going to get the respect that I deserve. Like, I don't need to be walking around like I'm some peasant. I need to be walking around like royalty. &gt;&gt; SIMON: Please repeat after me. I, Scott Disick... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I, Scott Disick... &gt;&gt; SIMON: ...affirm that... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...affirm that... &gt;&gt; SIMON: ...I will be faithful... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...I will be faithful... &gt;&gt; SIMON: ...and bear true respect and honor... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...and bear true respect and honor... &gt;&gt; SIMON: ...to the people of the manor... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...to the people of the manor... &gt;&gt; SIMON: ...and will be true to the laws of England and Wales. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...and be true to the lord... &gt;&gt; SIMON: ...to the laws of England and Wales. &gt;&gt; ROB: The laws. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...to the laws of England and Wales. &gt;&gt; SIMON: Amen. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Amen. &gt;&gt; SIMON: You just mind lowering your head slightly? I dub thee Lord of the Manor. Please rise, Scott, Lord of the Manor. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm feeling royal. This whole being knighted ceremony to becoming a Lord-- it's pretty amazing. I don't really know what's going on, but I'm loving it. This is fantastic. &gt;&gt; SIMON: With this crown, I crown you, Scott Disick, the new Lord of the Manor. Long live His Lordship. &gt;&gt; ROB: What is going on right now? This is not happening. &gt;&gt; SIMON: Please arise, my lord. Welcome to our fraternal brotherhood. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thank you. Thank you, sir. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Rob, hoist me. So, Rob and I are passing Trafalgar Square. And what better place to announce that Lord Disick is finally here? What's up, London?! Lord Disick is here! What's up, London?! 425 00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:51,857 &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Got it? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: So, Jonathan wants to go sightseeing, but I came out here for work, so I really need to get all my work done. Hi, everyone. Thank you so much for coming. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You're gorgeous in real life. It's so nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'll let her do her thing. I'm going to the food court. What's a good one? Hold on one sec. Sorry, hold on one sec. Hello. What am I doing? Well, you would be completely surprised. I'm walking around alone like an idiot around a mall. Kim is, like, on a, on, on, on a world tour here, doing a thousand appearances, and, uh, she's in her own world. I would only fly out here for her, but she's completely, like, neglected me, so if, if she keeps acting like this, I'm just gonna go home. I don't even think she'll notice. It's crazy. Okay, bye. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Car's here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, calm down. Okay, I'm trying. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What?! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go. We still got to pick up Khloe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you say "let's go" one more time, I'm going to stab myself in the eye with a fork. It's actually painful to travel with Bruce Jenner because when there is a, you know, situation where he doesn't have any control, he becomes antsy and he can snap and really become crazy. Maybe Khloe will finally see this side to him. Bye, everybody. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Who is it? &gt;&gt; ROB: It's Johnny. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And Lord Disick. &gt;&gt; KIM: Lord who? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Lord Disick. I just got granted Lord of the Manor. I have all my documentation if you don't believe me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Lordship of Chuckton Ford in the county of Shar... What is that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sharfanishani. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is this a joke? Like, he is so delusional and so full of himself. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm kind of a big deal. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, this changes everything. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kind of. I'll be expecting a little bit more respect from people when I meet them. I mean, I hope you understand. Here it is. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Are you going to change this on your driver's license back home? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. I would imagine people are going to be quick to knock my Lord title. Let the hating begin. I'm a Lord. They're just-- they're townspeople at this point to me. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: How'd you choose Lord? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It just seemed right. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Felt good? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Lord Disick-- I can call myself L.D. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I think it's kind of fun. It's definitely a different thing to do in London. At least people do different 480 00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:45,598 things when they're in London. &gt;&gt; KIM: Shut up. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you ready, Khlo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come in. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And why do you have an entire big bag? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're lucky I'm getting on the plane right now. I feel like such &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Terribly. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go. Khloe did the cardinal sin. She's got to check a bag for one night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wasn't able to try on any of my clothes, so I had to bring a bunch of It's okay, you guys don't have to wait. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So if you want to, you might as well check your garment bag. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can calm the down, because we're going to wait in Boston. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Excuse me... He's not saying he's not gonna wait. And you don't need to tell him to calm thedown. Like, relax. &gt;&gt; KRIS: People think that Bruce is this really mellow guy. Ha. But that's only because he's never around. The truth is, he is MIA 24/7. He's playing with his helicopters, he's on the golf course. He's doing things that are very singular. He's doing things on his own terms, and no one but me usually sees this crazy side of him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We haven't even gotten on the freeway. So relax. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you traveled with him before? It's lovely. It's an adventure. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've traveled with you many times. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Exactly, and I'm the perfect person to travel with. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's... okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is there a reason why we're taking Kris to this thing? You and I could do the whole thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't even know why I'm going to this thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We have, like, an hour and ten minutes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, here we go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We have to go... it starts at 9:00. So in just a little over an hour. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you're going to start an hour ahead of time, annoying us? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All right... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's keep it on schedule so we can get out of there on schedule. Okay? &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott thinks he's, like, too good, now that he's a Lord. He's just being very rude and disrespectful, and I kind of want nothing to do with him. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Lord Disick. How are you? &gt;&gt; ROB: Pleasure. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Since I'm royalty, I figure I may as well start with a little tea-time. Or should I say high tea? &gt;&gt; KIM: I've been Googling tea etiquette. "Never hold your cup with your pinky finger extended. This is considered rude." ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm in Boston right now, I just got here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Father-daughter bonding in baggage claim. It's good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ah, here it is! I'll take it. I got it, I'll take it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, there it is. &gt;&gt; PORTER: I'm doing it, I'm getting it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I know. I'll probably take it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lord almighty. Here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go. Let's go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wasn't that fun? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So fun. You basically stole it from that guy. Like, tore it out of that guy's hands. I don't know why Bruce would grab the luggage from him like that. I'm a little stunned by it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See, I always worry worry about, like, somebody else getting my bag, and it's, like, your bag doesn't make it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. Scott. Obviously, one of the things that inspired me to become royalty was the outfits. So I'd asked Rob to come with me and kind of go royal clothing shopping. I was looking just to get some kind of getup that... &gt;&gt; ROB: Show him your thing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah. You know, like this type of look, like a king. &gt;&gt; MAN: Christina! Christina's the guvnor. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm looking for, I guess, the tudor, some king-type feel. Is that weird? Hello. I kind of feel like Lil Wayne would wear this. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Any other options? &gt;&gt; ROB: Scotty. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah! It matches a lot of your clothes. &gt;&gt; ROB: It actually does. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That'swhat I'm talking about. Yeah! &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Get down! This fur cape/jacket, it's a little much, but I'm a Lord, so who's gonna tell me I can't do it? &gt;&gt; MAN: Here you are, young man. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I haven't had a cane in a while. I think I look like a gentleman. &gt;&gt; MAN: You are. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, some may say different. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. Two of us, please. &gt;&gt; MAN: Welcome to the Sea Grille. Two? Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. Mr. Perky has an autograph signing today. So I get to sneak in a peaceful lunch with Khloe. Have you ever had clam chowder? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you ever had it in Boston? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's why they call it Boston clam chowder. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, you don't even know why they call buffalo wings buffalo wings. So, Mom, I invited Bruce to our event tonight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna really regret this, but I'm kind of loving it. I look like the evil witch with the apple, but I'm really the mother that shields them, and I don't put them in certain scenarios where I know Bruce snaps. We're going in this car. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What car? What do you want a car for? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because they sent it for us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We can actually drive. Are you ready? Let's get out of here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: In a minute. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now. Let's get out now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. Khloe's gonna regret ever inviting Bruce to our event. But not to sound evil, I almost can't wait for her to witness it because she'll finally see what I'm talking about. You never see from my point of view what I have to deal with. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you feel sorry for him because you think I treat him badly when he, like, gets on my last nerve. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom's going on and on and on about Bruce, but again, that goes back to my mom being a little dramatic. Can I tell you something? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you were to respond a little kinder, especially around people, it might make them see your point easier. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so I'll try to be nicer, and you'll see what happens. &gt;&gt; ROB: Are you serious with all that hairspray? I can't believe you wear a small. What a &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, it's called being skinny, fat boy. &gt;&gt; ROB: You wear a women's small. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Lord Disick, bitch. Tonight, the appearance for Rob and I at this nightclub, I'm kind of going in there with more confidence than usual because I'm Lord Disick. Hopefully, they really give me the royal treatment. 615 00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:26,231 Get excited, Lord Disick's in the house. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Make some noise. Scott Disick is in the house! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Our VIP section's great, but the general public is very close. 620 00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:49,955 As a lord, I'll give some waves to people, but I'm not looking to touch skin. &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott and I are at this event; we're supposed to meet people, we're supposed to take pictures, and Scott just thinks he's, like, too good-- 'cause now that he's a Lord-- to do any of that. Then he has the nerve to get on the mic and he's shouting out, "I'm Lord Disick." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Lord Disick! &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott's usually the most social guy at these events, but now that he's, you know, 629 00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:32,030 royal, he thinks that he doesn't have to shake people's hands and whatnot. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do unto others as you would have others do unto you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That sounds like a bunch of bull &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, guys. Let's go. Come on, Kris, out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's raining. Do I need a...? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go. 636 00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:59,691 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Open thedoor and let's get out of here. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRISTOPHER: So, do you want to look slutty? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, why not? &gt;&gt; KRISTOPHER: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You only live once. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll be there to protect you if you look slutty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Don't worry. I got Lamar's back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can look like a slut. It doesn't mean I'm acting like one. My mom and I are getting all glammed up for our event that we have tonight. And I invited Bruce to come out with us because I feel sorry for him, and I think my mom does not include him enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now I know you're all getting ready, but we have, like, an hour and ten minutes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, here we go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We have to be downstairs at 8:45. It starts at 9:00. So you just got a little over an hour. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you're gonna start in a hour ahead of time annoying us? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can Team Glam get it done in an hour? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look how gorgeous I am. &gt;&gt; KRISTOPHER: She just likes to be tickled with the brushes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, and we're gonna tickle with brushes, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Anyway, let's keep it on schedule so we can get out 661 00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:59,651 of there on schedule. &gt;&gt; KRISTOPHER: Okay. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye's here on his 664 00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:13,498 tour, and it just so happened that we're both here in London at the same exact time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You designed it? &gt;&gt; KANYE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thiscrazy. &gt;&gt; KANYE: I know, right? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This has got a lot ofdepth. &gt;&gt; KANYE: It's made in the like Hermes factory. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, can I get a little shout-out, maybe? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just like a little something. Like, if you say, like, "Yo, Kim, I see you. And Scott, I don't see ya." I wouldn't be mad if Ye gave me a shout-out, saying, you know, "Lord Disick's in the audience." I mean, it only seems fair. I'd do the same for him if I was hosting a royal ball. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, I got us all passes to get in the back. And we're gonna go to this party after, so it'll be fun. &gt;&gt; JON: Yeah, fun, again, for the 15th time. Why don't you ask me what I want to do instead of just telling me where we're going again tonight? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I feel bad. It's, like... &gt;&gt; JON: Well, I don't think you feel too bad 'cause... &gt;&gt; KIM: But I do feel bad. &gt;&gt; JON: This is messed up. I'll see you later. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. &gt;&gt; ROB: Awkward. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just trying to organize this fun night. I got us tickets to the show. I don't understand why this is such a big issue for him. &gt;&gt; JON: You're really pissing me off. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's move it. Come on. We're already behind schedule. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think Bruce is very prompt and on time, but I just feel like he's adding more stress to this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go. Out the door right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love you and I want you here, that's why, you know, I said come out. &gt;&gt; JON: I thought that you 697 00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:39,818 needed me to come here 'cause you were alone. I'm just gonna do my own thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know it says "Do not disturb," but can I disturb you? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: So Jonathan just storms off. I have no idea what's bothering him. He's my best friend. I know something's wrong, and I need to talk to him. I just wanted to come and talk to you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I kind of, like, canceled all my stuff to come see you. I thought that you needed me to come here 'cause you were alone, and of course I would've come. But we're hanging out with 1,000 people every day. It's not fun. You know, next time, I'm just gonna just do my own thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like I've been, like, so, like, inconsiderate. I apologize. I, like, love you and I want you here. That's why, you know, I said come out. It wasn't that I, like, knew I was gonna be busy. Like, I always knew I was gonna be busy. I just wanted you to, like, be around and just hang out with all of us. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Just want you to know that it was an effort for you, but also I want us to be able to have some fun on my terms, as well. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. You don't ever have to feel like it's all about me and it's just, like, on my schedule. I mean, you don't have to, like, come with me to every event. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, you can go with Scott. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: There is things that I want to do, as well, and I want us to do together that I thought would be fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know Jonathan flew all the way out here and I haven't been spending a lot of time with him. And he just wants to hang out. So I want to, you know, change it up a little bit and make sure that I make time for Jonathan. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I just really didn't want to stress you out more, 'cause I see how much work you had to do, so I've been holding it in a little bit. Maybe sometimes it's better when I do this, because otherwise you're just, like, nonstop. &gt;&gt; KIM: Totally. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Like a train going to Paris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She can't bend over, Bruce. Now you just got to have all the fun by yourself. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You can put your shoes on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's 'cause I still bend over, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The two little Southern belles. Let's move it, come on. We're already behind schedule. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The event don't start till 9:30. It's 8:50, honey. No, the car gets here 15 minutes early. We ain't supposed to be in until 9:00. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How many people does it take to get you... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A village, honey. An entire mediocre village. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe, how many people does it take to get you ready? &gt;&gt; MAN: How many licks does it take... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To get to the center of Miss Jenner? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. I'll meet you out there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why's Bruce going if he just has a stinking little attitude? : I think Bruce is very prompt and on time, but also what he doesn't get is so are we. I know how to be an adult and show up on time. He has an irritable attitude. I mean, I do see where Kris could be coming from. Let's go if he really has an attitude. Like, I can't deal with that. We're coming. Mom's... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just checked; the car is here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. We will be coming. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, let's go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm getting... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, let's go. Out the door, right now. The door's this way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's why we shouldn't wake up so early, 'cause everyone has attitudes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are we going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: To the Gypsy club. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing at 9:00 something at night, honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's 6:30 in Los Angeles. It's-- nobody goes to bed at 6:30 in L.A., everyone is... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You do. I go up to the room at 7:00, and you're out cold. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, I'm thinking about-- I need more things to occupy my time-- I'm thinking about getting back into aviation. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That'll be fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get a small airplane, a little single-engine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not buying an airplane, Bruce. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She has so much life insurance on me, I'm worth more to her dead than I am alive. So you should be happy that I'm flying, honey. I should be racing cars. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, don't wish death... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If I go, you'll make millions. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't talk like that. I honestly feel so uncomfortable right now. I don't even know how it went from zero to 60. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, guys, let's go. Come on, Kris, out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's raining and we need umbrellas, and we're gonna... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm getting out. Or I'm climbing out the back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go. 792 00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:56,541 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, Bruce, calm... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Open thedoor and let's get out of here. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Lord, Lord, you got something in your tooth. &gt;&gt; KIM: Piece of gold? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No, it was a piece of mushroom. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll show you what I'm really trying to get. like that. &gt;&gt; KANYE: They definitely got that out here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You think? &gt;&gt; KANYE: They got the stores where you can buy, like, the full gold-plated everything. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I want to do that. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Now that he's, like, a Lord. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, stop encouraging him. I mean, Scott, it's like you can't buy your way into respect. If you want to be a Lord, you have to, like, live like one. You need to have proper manners and proper etiquette if you want people to really take you seriously as a Lord. You need to treat people with respect if you want to get that respect. I think Scott wanting to become a Lord has to do with him wanting, like, more respect. And I just don't think you can buy that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just want to hang out with royal folk. I don't like celebrities, like you and Kanye and I'm trying towith, like, royal people. &gt;&gt; KIM: So you want to bang the Queen. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hell no. She's, like, 1,000, and I got a girl. I just wanted to hang with her. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Should be more humble. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, not entitled, yes. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Right, humble. &gt;&gt; KIM: Exactly, not entitled. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sounds like a bunch of bull &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Now that you have a title, you should be non-entitled. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look, I'm, like, a lord of something. I'm just not sure what it is. 828 00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:24,762 I'm trying to figure it out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Douche lord. Today, it's all about you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's all about what my best friend wants today. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Okay, baby... &gt;&gt; KIM: Jonathan is such a good friend. Anytime there's something going on in my life, he drops 835 00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:48,052 everything to be there for me. I should make the time and do that for him. This is scary. Ah! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh! Do you think people have sex up here ever? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I think they do. This is so awesome. Really, I'm so happy we came. You never get to see London like this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Being here and seeing London from this view is so cool, and I'm so glad that he kind of forced me to do it. Will you take a picture of me? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You don't have 846 00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:15,513 enough pictures of you taken? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, with this sign. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, boys. I'm gonna go get a massage. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're gonna get a massage in here? &gt;&gt; KIM: You can do a full spa massage. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kim's going to Cannes Film Festival with Kanye, Jonathan's going to New York by himself, and then I get to go with Lord Disick. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 'Ello, govnor. Let me just first say thank you for being such a gracious host at Virgin Atlantic. And coming from a Lord, I hope 857 00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:56,888 that means something. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not looking forward to this flight. It's a pretty cool bar, actually. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kitchen! Bruce, can you turn the TV down? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I brought you a bottle of wine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was nice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Feel like we need a glass after that amazing Boston trip. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, I feel for you a little more. That trip sure was an eye-opener. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I thought we had a good time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For me, it was just a little too high-strung. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Agreed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I am a little high-strung. Tough to get you guys out the door. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Not really. We do just fine when we're on the road by ourselves. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, we're... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's shocking to me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How you guys can do anything without me around. But anyway, I'll try to be a little nicer, honey. I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Love you, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If there's one thing I could take away from my experience in Boston is I do think I owe my mom an apology and saying, "Okay, I do see where you're coming from." I've seen a little snappy side of Bruce. But I'm not gonna say that my mom's all right. They're both a little wacky. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't you have a golf game to watch? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, actually, I think I'm gonna go hit some balls. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you can't own your own pair, you might as well hit them. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Got it. Before she strips them off. 889 00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:21,906 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think that happened a long time ago, buddy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Would you come in here for a second, please? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm a little tired from London, and the Lord wouldn't mind an iced tea and some grapes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The Lord? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The Lord wants a little service in his own home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The Lord needs to get a reality check and realize that that's not happening. Kim filled me in on Scott thinking that he's royalty, which is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm the Lord of the Manor. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, well, I'm the queen of this house, so why don't you get me some grapes and... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why don't we both just lounge? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll have a coconut water. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why don't we both just lounge? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The Lord needs service. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am pregnant; I need to be catered to. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know what you are, and I always do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, get-- chop-chop. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's clear that I was a Lord in London, and it's clear that I am not royalty in my own home. Coconut water coming on up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I guess the Lord zone is over. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; ROB: What you think about me moving back into the Odom residence? You guys think I'm a moron, like I'm a little bitch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not gonna deal with this! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce is crazy about somebody else, and she's a supermodel. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just a little bit more there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sometimes I think maybe 924 00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:44,055 there is another chapter for me. &gt;&gt; WOMEN: Without Bruce? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah!
