- &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Been a long time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey there. We got you a salad. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just wanted a drink. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, Bruce's hair looks different. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good ol' Bruiser. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The Extentionator. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think that's his real hair. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I think he just got it blown out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just think it looks really good now. &gt;&gt; KIM: "Really good"? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's thick and lustrous; like, I wish, like that... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, she's right. I think he just puts product in it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: His hair looks really good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, should I call Brian Bowen Smith for my photo shoot? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sure. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What is, what is this photo shoot? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A nude preggo shoot. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? For, like, a porn mag? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Penthouse. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've always wished Penthouse. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, Brian. It's Kourtney. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Hey, girl! What's up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just told Scott I'm doing a naked pregnancy shoot and... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You better bring, uh, your cameras and a weed wacker! You know, when her stomach is hanging over things, I don't think she realizes how unkempt her lawn can get. I think she forgets that hair still grows downstairs. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you think? Should we do it at my house or...? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You should do it at the gynecologist's with your legs up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott, Scott said at the gynecologist with my legs up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Pow! &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Yeah, I mean, I mean, that's the best way to see the baby. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Then obviously we can retouch nipples and bush or whatever... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's gonna be a lot of retouching. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was... Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: One more? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Very European. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just got back from Paris. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Very Europe. Kourt told me that you... they would come here as kids a lot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All the time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This was one of our go-tos. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I like it here. I was gonna tell you now that you're newly single and running about the town... &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...it's time for you to start hosting your own parties. Everybody else is doing it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: In a club? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. I've got multiple offers for you for hosting your birthday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Multiple offers"? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, let's not say "multiple," but a few. You should be hosting your birthday party. It's your coming out party. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't think that... It's not even age appropriate for me to go to a club and go give me a cake! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: First of all, what does that mean? You're in the entertainment business and you're a celebrity. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I'm just gonna go sit up in a club and shake my booty... and get paid. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You do it for free when you manage your girls. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You go to parties with them, you walk the carpet. You might as well get paid for it and let them come with you for once. I'll go. I'll support you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I... Will you go? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm a little reluctant to host an event because I'm used to being the manager, not the client, but Scott is pretty convincing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's in Vegas, by the way. I didn't mention that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, easy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And it's at 1 OAK, and they love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like it. I always have a good time when I go to Vegas, so it's a good opportunity. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll get you a written offer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: As long as you'll go with me, I'm in. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's a deal, baby. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Look how big this is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mase, this is Dr. Crane. He was your doctor that delivered you when you were born. Did you know that? &gt;&gt; MASON: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know? You remember him? &gt;&gt; MASON: I'm gonna see the baby, Mama. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're gonna see. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, look, we're gonna see. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Everything okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I feel just huge, and I feel so much movement. &gt;&gt; CRANE: All right, that's all good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am 37-weeks pregnant, and I can't believe that I'm going to be having my third baby in less than a month. &gt;&gt; CRANE: All right, we're gonna have a quick look at the baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: See the machine? &gt;&gt; MASON: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's Mommy's belly-- inside. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's his head, Mase. &gt;&gt; MASON: Oh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really don't know what life is like with three kids, so I am anxious and nervous, but excited. &gt;&gt; CRANE: So, the baby does measure a couple weeks bigger than average. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; KIM: That's the baby's heart. That's his heartbeat. &gt;&gt; MASON: Oh. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Everything's great. The baby's growing. He's still a nice-size kid. Plenty of movement. Good breathing movements. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; CRANE: So you're in good shape. &gt;&gt; MASON: That was cool. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Was that cool? &gt;&gt; ROYA: I was in 10eleven Showroom the other day, and they showed me a picture of you wearing these little Soludos shoes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The calf-hair ones are kind of cute 'cause they're kind of, like, the Céline? &gt;&gt; ROYA: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, these perforated leather and then maybe, like, the leopard... &gt;&gt; ROYA: Mm-hmm. I kind of want to start doing a little bit more, like, accessories, so people can kind of like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would love that. &gt;&gt; ROYA: ...match it up a little bit; so, belts hats, shoes... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to see those 'cause those look like stuff me and Kim were saying we needed in the store. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love these. &gt;&gt; ROYA: Okay, last order of business-- security. We've had a very large influx of theft in New York... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; ROYA: ...in the last, like, month; like, people have, like, went in and stolen, like, two, like, torn outfits, like, totaling, like, over a thousand dollars, like, each and this has happened several times. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How did they steal it? &gt;&gt; ROYA: They go in the dressing room-- you know how our dressing rooms are, like, behind?-- and then they are, like, scooting out of there with it in their bags. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think people that are, like, on duty, it's, like, their responsibility to keep an eye, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...our sales employees. &gt;&gt; ROYA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is the first time I am ever hearing about a theft problem at DASH New York. It really infuriates me and I really want to hold the DASH Dolls responsible. Part of their job is to protect our merchandise, our store and our brand. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Should we have Kim go in and have a talk with the girls there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think Kim should. Why not? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Here, Kylie. You're gonna bump Jonathan's new selfie. One, two... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe don't do duck lips. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I only know how to do duck lips and they were Khloe lips before the duck took them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, listen. Who wants to go with me...? Hello? Paying attention. Who wants to go with me to my birthday bash in Vegas? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're kidding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're really having a birthday bash? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, Scott got me an appearance deal, and I said I think it's a little age inappropriate to have a birthday party in Vegas... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: So, you're gonna go, like... do a whole thing? Like, waving and everything, like the kids do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Get up on the mic. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Waving? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's kind of weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You gonna wear, like, a short dress? 'Cause that's what the kids want to see. You can't wear a pantsuit. Like, do not wear one of your executive meeting suits... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like this? This is my little executive pants suit. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: If you show up to the club like that, you're gonna be the manager of the casino. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is no way! Like, right now, I'm ready for you to start, like, dealing cards to us. Can you tap... hit, hit me? Hit me. Khloe, raise her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, there's, like, scrubs to clean. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The toothbrush? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Apparently. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude. I can use that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, you were upset that I don't want to shave for the photo shoot? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, it's a little offensive. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: First of all, it's lucky enough that I can shave my legs. There is a huge stomach here in the way. So, like, you're asking a lot to shave down there, but I'm down. I just need some assistance. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Listen to me. If you were to ask me, you would've known when I was 11 years old, I worked at a barber shop for three days. I can trim you up real nice. It's gonna run you about $13.50, though. Her bush is hanging out like it's the 80s, and I'm not gonna stand for that. So, if I got to get my hands dirty, I will. You're in the right place, little girl. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're gonna use that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Honey, I'm gonna part you like the Red Sea! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That thing is not going inside of me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You have hair growing inside of you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, but, like, the edges; you got to get in there a little. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't mind doing a little swoopereeny! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want me to lay here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, let's do a before and after for Insta. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. Stop! I don't want a before and after. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're doing a little vageen trim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, can we make some moves? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Flip around. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What about this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't see anything, so this is a lot of trust! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you being serious now? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is disgusting. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you looking at what you're doing? 'Cause I can't see. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's looking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ow! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You'll be all right! You'll be all right! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're kidding. Buddy, this reminds me of a water birth. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It almost looks like she's giving birth to a little man with a very hairy little head. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You want to take a peek? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Gorgeous. Shines like the top of the Chrysler Building. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All hooked up, partner. Now give me that $13.50. Boom, there it is, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yep. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I see you, girl. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie... Look at those bronzes. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah... &gt;&gt; KIM: And look at that. Can I get this... this one? &gt;&gt; SALESWOMAN: Sure. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm gonna get that, too. &gt;&gt; SALESWOMAN: Sure, honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: And then, can I get that gold? &gt;&gt; SALESWOMAN: Sure. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, should I get it, too? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it's a good one. I think it might be a life-changer. Oh, I need some of this, too. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You know what's so weird, that I heard? &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That Mom has a, um... club appearance, or whatever? In Vegas? &gt;&gt; KIM: What? Wait-- Mom... has a club appearance. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. But isn't that kind of weird? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, desperate. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Right? &gt;&gt; KIM: Usually, my mom's job is to book the nightclubs for us, not really her job to be hosting them, so... I just find the whole thing so weird. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think Scott set it up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Of course he did. I'm definitely gonna try to talk my mom out of doing this. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. You have to help me pack for Vegas. Do you like this little number for, like, my club appearance? &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't believe, like, in all honesty, that you're doing a club appearance. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't, either. Like, who would even want me to do a club appearance? But Scott booked it, and he's dying for me to do it, so I said... &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, you need to grow some balls and start doing things that are good for, like, you and your image. I think Scott wants to book the nightclub for his own selfish reasons. His motivation is not really what's in the best interest of my mom. I think it's more like he... just wants to book my mom so that he gets a cut of it. Like, I would be really worried. If I were you, I'd really cancel. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's gonna freak out, if I cancel. &gt;&gt; KIM: You just shouldn't have done it in the first place. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I already felt a little bit conflicted and uncomfortable, and now Kim is making me feel like this is a really bad idea. &gt;&gt; KIM: Trust me. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Ready, babe? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Ah, that's really pretty right there. Do a lot of women hate you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm having second thoughts... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're backing out. It's making me look completely irresponsible. If she ever saw one of her daughters backing out of a deal, she'd lose their number forever! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I don't want to disappoint anybody, but I don't want to look like an ass &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Guess what. Now I'm gonna look like an ass ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Monica, were you there when I did my other pregnant shoot, with Mason? And I was, literally, just naked. &gt;&gt; MONICA: Yeah. The photos came out really pretty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I loved... &gt;&gt; MONICA: That's the one your mom has up in her room. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I did a naked pregnant photo shoot, when I was pregnant with Mason, and I didn't get a chance to do one with Penelope, but I really wanted to do one, again, this time, so I'm excited. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Okay, here we go. It's gonna happen, fast. Ready, babe? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: There you go, right there. That's beautiful. Don't move. Gorgeous! Beautiful! Nice. Good, good, good. Chin up! Turn your body towards me a little bit more. Right there. That's beautiful! Right there-- there you go! Good. Right there. Right there. Don't move, don't move. Do a lot of women hate you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let me get through here. Oh, my goodness! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And your car. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Oh, that's really pretty, right there. Oh, my God! Gorgeous! Don't move! Don't move, don't move. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously, so pretty. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're... is one nipple supposed to be out right now? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you wearing underwear, or no? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wow, you got some balls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This isn't a laughing shoot. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, this is an angry shoot? Got a child in there, for crying out loud. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I didn't even know you were this pretty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I learn something new every day. Seeing Kourtney at the photo shoot, and noticing how well-sculpted she is downstairs, makes me really believe that I do have more than one talent. She does look quite amazing. I mean, she's really got a glow to her, so... I'm pretty proud of her. You look great. Extra specially nice. If Kourt ever needs a hand again, I'll lend it to her. But I'll probably charge next time. You're gonna put clothes on? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's a sheer thing. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: It's see-through. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can't see that happening. ♫ ♫ Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's happening? You know, Kris asked me to come over. With Kris Jenner, there's always some kind of problem. I have no idea, really, what's going on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am just looking for Robert's sock in the new Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog. Here they are-- look! "Arthur George," by Robert Kardashian-- how cute. Cashmere, right here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, those are nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aren't those great? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's a great little item. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um... I'm having second thoughts about this club appearance... because I really feel like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, I feel like it's a little late for second thoughts now. It's around the corner. They already promoted it. You have a billboard of yourself on the Vegas Strip. I mean... &gt;&gt; KRIS: A billboard? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, that's what they do with these club appearances-- they promote. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just feel like, don't you think it's a little silly for me to be at a nightclub, like, going: "Whoo! Happy birthday!" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, what I think is silly, when you go to nightclubs for free, with your daughters, when they're hosting parties, and you stand there, as the manager. This way, you're getting your fee and your management fee. You go with them-- what's the difference? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you sure you're not thinking more about... your business situation... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yes, I am. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...than the way that I look, and my reputation? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Correct. Now it's becoming a problem for me, if you say no, only because they started promoting it. I would say, if it was two, three weeks out-- yeah, you could cancel it. But they already spent money and time promoting it, and now what? They're gonna ask for that money back from me, if you cancel. I know Kris knows better than to back out of a deal at the last minute. If she ever saw one of her daughters backing out of a deal, she'd lose their number forever! So the fact that she's gonna do this to me is absolutely ridiculous. And then, at the end of the day, we both look bad, we both don't make money, and we look like a bunch of flakes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I just feel like this is a lot of pressure, and I really, honestly feel like you're not looking out for your mom. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course I'm looking out for you! I'm going with you, to enjoy it with you! I pushed and pulled to get the deal done, and now you're backing out, and now it's making me look completely irresponsible. I booked you, everybody was happy, you agreed, and now it's more of a relationship factor for me than money. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I don't want to disappoint anybody, but I don't want to look like an ass &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, guess what. Now I'm gonna look like an ass! &gt;&gt; KIM: There's been a lot of theft at the store, so I have set up every security camera you can imagine. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We're gonna watch him steal. &gt;&gt; KIM: I see him putting something in his pocket... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah! &gt;&gt; KIM: Sal is stealing things, right in from of them. This is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What the? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You booked me on this event, and you've been M.I.A. all day long... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don'tpanic! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, at this point, Scott's full-on drunk. &gt;&gt; MAN: You gotta simmer down. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, you ain't gotta put it like that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't want to look like an ass &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Guess what. Now I'm gonna look like an ass Wouldn't you freak out if one of your talent pulled out, at the last minute, on a deal that you had them in? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It would be bad business, for sure. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bad business! And you know that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Well, now that you say it like that, and you think I'm not gonna look like a complete fool... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Absolutely not! &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...hosting a birthday party, at my age, in a Vegas club... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If I am still getting offers to host parties, at your age, I will be thanking God, because it's amazing! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not sure if it's the best idea for me to go to Vegas, but Scott has some really good points. It's not gonna do anybody any good for me to back out of this now. I've made a commitment, and it's my job to see it through. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Age is just a number! &gt;&gt; KRIS: We'll go and have a nice, low-key night... I don't have to do anything crazy, like dance on a table... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's 90 minutes! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you dance on the table, I could get you an extra ten grand, though. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me think about it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No problem. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Hey! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, guys! Hi, Sal. &gt;&gt; SAL: Hi, how are you? How's everything? Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's up? Mwah! &gt;&gt; KIM: It is so rainy. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is like the worst weather I've seen in months. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ever, right? I prefer New York when it's, like, either snowing or, like, muggy and hot. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah. Are you hungry? I'm so hungry, I'm literally gonna throw up. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so hungry. Ooh, thank you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: All right, tell me why we... why we dragged Sal out of his important job. &gt;&gt; KIM: I brought you here because there's been a lot of theft at the store. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Stop. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney and Khloe want me to help figure out what's going on with the theft at DASH. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Do you know who... anything, any info on, like, who could it be? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-mm. We gotta figure it out. I thought of an amazing way. I'm asking Jonathan and his friend Sal, from his security team, to help me figure this out and solve the problem. So I told them that we are redoing the security system, for the theft that was going on. I have-- you're gonna die-- set up a full Sprinter, with every security camera you can imagine. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Wait, this is amazing-- you have a full van, like stocked...? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, so, we'll be watching you, and we'll give you an earbud, and we'll talk to you... and I thought, maybe, if we sent you in to, like, go get something for, like, your wife. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're going undercover, Sal. But this time, you're, like, the good guy. &gt;&gt; SAL: I'm always the good guy. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; WOMAN: They're gonna have someone walk you down the carpet, and then Sean, who's your security, will be with you, too, on the carpet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're a real workaholic, let me tell you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think, Mr. Manager? I think that the older I get, the more I appreciate my ability to stay alive in a club. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I hear ya. I'm getting there, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You do a good job with that crowd, in that world, and you're really good at it. You just need to lay off the alcohol. I wish you could get to the place where you could have a couple drinks and enjoy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Me, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause we all get a little out of our minds... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and that's a trait that's not pretty for any of us. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know I already committed to go to Vegas, but I'm a little worried about Scott. He always gets into a bunch of trouble. My biggest fear is he takes 12 steps backwards, and really falls off the wagon. I want Scott to know that this is a real professional trip, and there's gonna be no crazy drinking. You're gonna have three little children at home, very soon, under the age of five. Mason adores you; he worships the ground you walk on. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I understand. Okay, we don't need to... we don't need to take it that far-- I get it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's a big responsibility. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That, by the way, could put me over the edge. So you're only scaring me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I don't want to scare you. I want to encourage you to be the best that you can be. You know, it's the people that influence you, and it's who you surround yourself with... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, it's crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That kind of energy can take you down so fast... and we should understand, like, what could really happen to any of us, if we were... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yes... &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...surrounded ourselves by the wrong people. &gt;&gt; KIM: I hired this team of experts on surveillance and we completely rigged the entire DASH store in the middle of the night, putting hidden cameras and microphones and stuff everywhere. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Let me see this. Hold on, how many cameras you got, first of all? &gt;&gt; AARON: We got nine cameras throughout the store. One, of course, by the register, one in your VIP room; and have mics set up by your registers here, so... &gt;&gt; KIM: We can hear them? &gt;&gt; AARON: Yes. So, Sal, this is... ...your earbud that you'll be putting in your ear. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is awesome. &gt;&gt; AARON: Kim and Jonathan, this is where you'll be speaking into the mic to give him direction. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; AARON: This whole world is yours now. I'll be stepping out. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Thank you, thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have always loved investigating. I am the best spy. I can figure everything out. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Sal, one-two, one-two? &gt;&gt; SAL: Yes, all right, so you guys are ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Get out. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is so exciting just to see this all finally, like, really go down. Our spy is entering the store. I can't wait to see what happens. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: There he is. There he is, there he is, there he is, there he is. &gt;&gt; KIM: This stuff makes me so nervous. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Sal, just pretend you're in your old days in Bay Ridge stealing a car. &gt;&gt; KIM: None of the girls are even paying attention to him. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No one's even asked him if needs any help. &gt;&gt; KIM: No one. &gt;&gt; SAL: Excuse me. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, no. Shh, shh. &gt;&gt; SAL: Can anybody help me? &gt;&gt; DASH DOLL: Yes. &gt;&gt; SAL: I need some help. I just want to get something really hot for my wife, and she loves Kim; she's obsessed with her. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Ask her why Kim is always naked in pictures. &gt;&gt; DASH DOLL: Does she wear more of, like, skirts or... &gt;&gt; SAL: Be honest with you, if she was anything like Kim, she'd be wearing nothing. I'm a joker. You can't laugh? You know, go, "Ha, ha, ha"? No? Where are you going? Wow, nobody likes to help me? Do I look like a criminal or something? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, he's trying to steal. I know that slow crawl. Look, look! Look at him! Watch him, watch him steal. Right in front of her. &gt;&gt; KIM: I see him putting something in his pocket. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he already took something! &gt;&gt; KIM: I get that Sal kind of scared the girls off by being aggressive. I know when I worked in retail, if there was a guy that we thought was creepy, we'd kind of stay away from him. But at the very least, if they're suspicious, they should be keeping a closer eye on him. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I would be so mad if this was my store. Like, what the? &gt;&gt; KIM: I am furious. This is ridiculous. Sal is stealing things right in front of them. It's like they're not even paying attention. I'm just shocked. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sal, oh, you stole this? &gt;&gt; SAL: Woman was behind me when I took it. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: They let you, so they let you steal it, you think? &gt;&gt; SAL: Well, if an ass like me walks in there, don't you think they should watch me, like, a little bit closer? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We haven't even gotten to the club yet and I'm seriously worried for his behavior. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don'tpanic! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're an ass &gt;&gt; KIM: I see him putting something in his pocket. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he already took something. I would be so mad if this was my store. Like, what the? &gt;&gt; DASH DOLL: Have a good rest of your day, okay? &gt;&gt; SAL: It's been such a pleasure. Bye, girls. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sal... oh, you stole this? &gt;&gt; SAL: One of them was behind me when I took it, so it was, like, in front of them. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: They let you, so they let you steal it, you think? &gt;&gt; SAL: Well, if an ass like me walks in there and starts talking like that, don't you think they should watch me, like, a little bit closer? &gt;&gt; KIM: Totally. &gt;&gt; SAL: I mean, just like... &gt;&gt; DASH DOLL: His breath smelled like alcohol, too. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, his breath smelled like something! They're talking about you. They said your breath smelled like... ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, hi! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: How are you, gorgeous? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I did this for you. This is for your birthday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look hot! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Thank you! Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love the energy in Vegas and I love the way it feels to be here; it's exciting. Hey! &gt;&gt; COREY: You look beautiful. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I'm really looking forward to dinner tonight and then going to the club. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoa! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: That clutch is perfect! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Not bad for having a birthday party at the age of 140. &gt;&gt; COREY: Oh, man. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Where's Scott? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. They-they were seen in another hotel, and he doesn't know I know. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, shocking. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott's the one who set this appearance up, and I still haven't even seen him. And I'm getting a little bit nervous because I'm starting to get texts from people telling me that Scott's out and about already drinking. And we haven't even gotten started yet. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Now, are we almost... Sal, where's that friend of yours? Is she here? &gt;&gt; SAL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Call her now. Let's go, hurry up. Tell her to take a minute off work. &gt;&gt; KIM: We sent Sal in to steal some things and figure out how our store was really being taken over by this theft. But I have a feeling that, you know, maybe girls are stealing when they're in the dressing rooms. So we're gonna send in one of Sal's friends to try it a different way and figure out all the different angles on how the theft can really be going on. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Hey! How are you? &gt;&gt; SAL'S FRIEND: Good. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Just walk in and, like, go-- couple of things in the dressing room, pretend you're trying it on. "Oh, it's great, it's great, it's great. All right, thank you." Steal one and then walk out. Say, "I'll be back later." &gt;&gt; SAL'S FRIEND: Okay. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That's it. &gt;&gt; SAL'S FRIEND: Okay. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: All right. We'll be watching you. &gt;&gt; SAL'S FRIEND: A little nervous. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Wow, she's fast. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's going in the dressing rooms. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I hope she, I hope she can pull it off. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look. She's just walking out. No one's even talking to her. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Wow. Oh, it's snowing fully. &gt;&gt; SAL'S FRIEND: I did it. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You did it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Wow, you stole? &gt;&gt; SAL: How-how'd it go? &gt;&gt; KIM: What did you take? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Wait, turn it down, Kim. Turn that thing down. We're-we're done with them. They're all getting fired. &gt;&gt; KIM: What did you take? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No. No. &gt;&gt; SAL'S FRIEND: This thing that I put here. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just so disappointed in the girls. The fact that she just walked out with our merchandise on without anyone seeing. I mean, I definitely see now that our New York store has a huge theft problem. I am furious. This store used to do so well. And there's just been a lot of theft. So I want you guys to know we had the entire place rigged, and we've been watching you all day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to tell me what happened in Vegas? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was so crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I heard him come home, and it's just like, "Are you drinking again or...?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you ask him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I mean, it's obvious; it's not a question. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's not trying. He's a &gt;&gt; KIM: I am furious. I'm gonna walk in there. The girls are busted. Even though Sal was aggressive and scared the girls off, they should be keeping a closer eye on him. It's time to let them know we've been spying on them and watching them, and this just isn't acceptable. Everyone, come in the back. So... ...there's been a lot of theft. So, last night, we had the entire place rigged with cameras and we've been watching you all day from across the street in a Sprinter van. I honestly, I just can't even begin to tell you how shocked I am. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: All right, guys. So, you do remember Sal? &gt;&gt; SAL: Long time, no see. &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, he works for Jonathan, and he stood literally in front of someone and just put it in his jacket. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: And nobody noticed. Wow. &gt;&gt; KIM: If there's this much theft, we have to take it seriously and get a better system. We just got to figure it out, because I really, you know, think that this store is, like, who we are. And, you know, I don't want to give up on it. I want to prove that doing little exercises like this and coming out and, like, meeting with you guys really can change things. &gt;&gt; FALYNN: Okay, I definitely want to prove you right, for sure. So I think we can all work on that and, uh, really be on top of this theft issue. &gt;&gt; KIM: My sisters and I have worked really hard on our DASH store for years. I hope that they take this really seriously and don't ever allow this to happen again. All right, bye, guys. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Bye, guys. &gt;&gt; SAL: All right, we're gonna get going, man. Okay, girls. See you girls later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can we order a drink? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: A little character enhancer never hurt anybody. Come here, Scotty. You're sitting next to me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yo, what up? &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, you booked me on this event, and you've been M.I.A. all day long. I don't even know what I'm supposed to do... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Aw, you're gonna be fine, you're gonna walk in, you're gonna do a little striptease, you'll be all right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, French be coming in. Yo... Yo, you a Hollywood-ass, man. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, at this point, Scott's full-on drunk. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Scott, no! Scott! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No, Scott! &gt;&gt; KRIS: And we haven't even gotten to the club yet and I'm seriously worried. I've really got to get him to slow down or we're gonna have a huge problem. &gt;&gt; COREY: He's been drinking that 89 unleaded gasoline. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don'tpanic! We're just getting started! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're an ass &gt;&gt; MAN: Kris Jenner! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott, you! What theare you doing? Scott's had way too much to drink at this point. And he's getting out of hand. Youhit me in the head. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where's our tea? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Want me to get you some? 'Cause I threw it away. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You threw it away?! Why would you throw it away? Where was it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was cleaning up. I'm so sorry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where? I'll get a new straw literally. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I, like, poured it down the drain. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY:What a monster! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, what do you want? Do you want me to make you some tea? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. Like, I could put tea bags in water and put it with ice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Steep you some tea? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-mm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want me to go have...? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just want water actually. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I normally don't wait on Kourtney hand and foot. Coconut or sparkling? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Regular. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But she's eight-and- a-half-months pregnant, so... miracles happen! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My stomach is, like, cramping. I wonder if I should time it. I don't think so, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you time what? Your... contractions? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If it happens, could you imagine? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott called me and he is drunk. I don't want to tell Kourt. She's eight-and-a-half-months pregnant, she's stressed out. This is the last thing that she needs. And to be honest, I really thought we were done with this chapter after the Hamptons, but apparently it's just gonna keep on going and going and going. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Happy birthday, Kris! &gt;&gt; COREY: Happy birthday, baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks for coming, everybody. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Thanks for inviting us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you for coming. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ha! Man! Andre,you! You ain't on this side no more! Don't tell your girlfriend you here! So, uh, is Faye gonna get naked on the ride home? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't believe he got drunk. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yo! You're flirting with me! &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, but he was on such a good path, but I knew I was gonna get in trouble bringing him here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Enough is enough, man! That's enough! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott, you need to eat something, honey. Scott? Scott! Don't ignore me! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't panic! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You've got to eat something! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, it's your birthday. I'm excited for you. But you've been talking to me all wrong... since 1990. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: This is getting scary! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And now I'm just trying to, I'm trying to not be who I am. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Told me to take out the trash. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? I love you. &gt;&gt; COREY: Scott, Scott, you got to... you got to simmer down... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, you ain't got to put it like that. &gt;&gt; COREY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm watching you. Scott's really crossing a line. My prayer now is that Scott stays funny, happy Scott and doesn't turn into cranky, angry Scott. I actually cannot wait until this night is over. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yo, shall we hit the club? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Are you ready? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; DEEJAY: Ladies and gentlemen, for a very special birthday... everybody... please help me to welcome Kris Jenner! Happy birthday, girl! Congratulations, Kris Jenner, another year older! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; DEEJAY: You've got to help me here, Las Vegas, in wishing a very special happy birthday to my girl, Kris Jenner in the building! Happy birthday, Kris! &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're at 1 OAK, and they really, really went all out for me. And still, in the back of my mind, I've got to think about Scott, and I just hope that I don't have to end up babysitting him all night. Where's Scott? Scott? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott! Get up here! Scott! Scott! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Don't be a You owe me abag! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How much is that bag? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I want one tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know what to do. Scott's had way too much to drink at this point, and he's getting out of hand. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS:! I have a lot of anxiety right now, because I feel like Scott's behavior is escalating to another level. And I've been around way too long to know that it doesn't always end well. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS:! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am so angry with Scott right now, and I appreciate the apology, but I'll accept it if he comes with me, gets on a plane and goes home, because the last thing I need is for Kourtney to be upset at me for what's happening with Scott. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: And those little high-tops. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: These are cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Take those. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm... do you want to tell me what happened in Vegas, or no? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What happened? He was calling me all night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know what was going on. It was so crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I heard him come home, and it's just, like, "Are you drinking again, or...?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you ask him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I mean, it's... it's obvious, it's not a question. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, I felt really bad that he was getting like that when he was on my watch. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, that's not your fault. I'm just... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, it's my fault for encouraging him. That's like saying, "Oh, I know he's a drug addict, but here's some drugs." You're gonna be mad at me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not mad. I'm not mad at anyone. It's nobody's fault. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, how does it make you feel? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I could rationalize, like, he goes out once in a while with his friends and whatever, like everyone, you know, can want to go out or whatever, but... I did say if he was going out, he just can't come home that night. The frustrating part is that he goes from, like, one... extreme to the next, and that, like, he gets on this bandwagon of, like, "Oh, I'm gonna be this and have this great summer" and whatever, and then he changes it suddenly without even talking about it with anybody. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just wish he would do things, if at all, in moderation. It's kind of... it's tough. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, he doesn't have that capability. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you like this color? Ultimately, Scott is responsible for his own behavior, but now I know for sure that I would never want to put Scott in another situation where there's alcohol involved. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's just, like... annoying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like you said, he's not trying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's not trying. He's a He's rude. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All the time? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. Off and on. Sometimes he's, like, "Oh, my God, you're the best thing that's ever happened to my life," and, "What would I do without you?" and, "I want to change," and, "I want to be there for you guys," and then the next day, he'll be, like, "Pssh. You're showing me baby clothes? Why would I care about that?" You know? He's just, he's literally schizophrenic. I truly hope that Scott's Vegas binge was just a one-time thing and that he really can get it together, because the baby is due soon and I cannot deal with this right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you're gonna have a problem on your hands if he keeps doing this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's, like, the same old thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. It's just, like, it's such a roller coaster that it's frustrating. ♫ ♫ On the next, "Keeping Up with the Kardashians..." &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm in Miami celebrating my magazine cover. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Baby number three's coming and you're gonna have to figure it out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott is anxious and nervous about having a third baby. I just don't know can I rely on to be there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll probably be there. 50-50. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like we're being followed. Is there somebody in the backyard? Look. Look. Look! I know it sounds paranoid, but I feel like this stalker has been watching us, and it's terrifying. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So, I just got word the stalker might have gotten a nude video of you from your closet camera. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What the?
